  abstract={Background: Software development is a knowledge-intensive and creative activity requiring human ingenuity, thus, sustainability from an engineer's perspective (i.e., meeting an engineer's personal and professional needs while maintaining their mental and physical well-being) must be achieved and maintained. Aims: With this paper, we aim to bring attention to the currently overlooked aspect of sustainability from an individual engineer's perspective. Method: Through an analysis of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies, this research demonstrates a lack of research investigating the individual (human) dimension of sustainability in the current software engineering literature. Results: The analysis of the literature reviews reveals that the current research has mainly focused on reducing the energy footprint of software systems. Thus, revealing the renewed need for paying attention to the individual engineer's perspective. Conclusion: Future research should leverage contributions from related research areas like human aspects in software engineering (e.g., topics like cognition and motivation). There is a need for identifying factors that impact sustainability at an individual level and their interplay with the team and organization level practices, policies, and decisions. The overall ambition is to develop empirically validated guidelines and best practices to measure, improve and maintain sustainability from an engineer's perspective. Such measures are expected to ensure engineers' sustainability and enable highquality software development.},

  abstract={Software is now a vital scientific instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent 'reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers - the people actively developing software in an academic research environment - subjectively define software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.},

  abstract={Sustainability is becoming an important topic in IT - as contribution of IT to safeguard our future, and as evolving market segment. IT's high productivity in combination with short life cycles and, on the other hand, growing resource problems of our planet, lead to a necessity that software engineers take their share of responsibility for sustainability. Therefore, we need to include the concept of sustainability into the university curriculum of computer science. The challenge is to motivate and interest students (and lecturers) for sustainability, to identify spheres of activity for software engineers, to build up competence fields for solutions, and to incorporate the topic into the syllabus. This paper presents a strategy for integrating the concept of sustainability into a degree course scheme across three stages: find a core of interested people by offering a seminar, then broaden the awareness for sustainability by offering a lecture series, and finally establish the topic by offering teach-the-teacher seminars and integration into software engineering lectures.},

Examples include e-waste from computers made obsolete due to software upgrades, and changes in the power demands of new versions of software. Sustainable software engineering aims to create reliable, long-lasting software that meets the needs of users while reducing environmental impacts. We conducted three related research efforts to explore this area. First, we investigated the extent to which users thought about the environmental impact of their software usage. Second, we created a tool called GreenTracker, which measures the energy consumption of software in order to raise awareness about the environmental impact of software usage. Finally, we explored the indirect environmental effects of software in order to understand how software affects sustainability beyond its own power consumption. The relationship between environmental sustainability and software engineering is complex; understanding both direct and indirect effects is critical to helping humans live more sustainably.},

  abstract={Ten years ago, it was usual that projects in the software industry ran on for years before the customer was able to lay his hands on the product he had ordered. This often resulted in delays, budget overruns and disappointing deliverables. During the last decade, the Agile approach has been taking over software project management, shortening product development cycles from a few years to a few weeks or even days. Recently, the agile approach has even been used for developing a new car which runs 100 miles per gallon [1]. Several recent surveys [2], [3] show that agile methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming or Kanban have successfully been adopted by many companies to develop software. However, agile methodologies do not come for free. A different set of skills, or agile practices as they are called, are necessary for the software engineers in order to be able to sucessfully deliver high-quality software at the end of every iteration. The same surveys show that only few of the agile practices are used and even fewer are applied consequently and thoroughly. This is to a great extent due to the lack of skilled software engineers. Although teaching agile software development has drawn some attention in recent research, we do not yet seem to be able to “deliver” the appropriately skilled engineers. What is the reason for this, and more importantly, how can we improve the situation? In this position paper we propose a more holistic approach for teaching agile software engineering, in which the required agile practices and values are not only integrated theoretically but also practically applied and repeated until they become a habit to students and software engineers.},

The development of blockchain-oriented software should always be performed in the awareness of the potential effects generated from its use, especially in a long-term life cycle perspective. In other terms in the awareness of its present and future sustainability. By using the principles of sustainability software design and recognized the role of blockchain-oriented Agile methodologies to manage changes in technology and requirements, we present a new Agile method for the development of blockchain-oriented systems that includes sustainability awareness practices within the development phases, in particular in the requirements and the acceptance tests. This allows to deal with blockchain-oriented systems sustainability immediately and during the incremental and iterative development process. The paper describes the process in its phases and provides an example of an application to the supply chain sector.},

  abstract={Sustainability and environmental impact are important factors to consider in the software industry and especially in the training of the professionals who produce it. The non-renewable and increasingly limited resources of our planet generate the need to train engineers in the software area to assume their responsibility for sustainable development. Progress should be made in the inclusion of sustainable development principles in the curricula in the training of future software engineers. This article presents an analysis and monitoring of scientific publications, using bibliometric indicators in order to obtain and provide information on current research trends in the training of professionals in the area of software engineering with principles of sustainable development. For this reason, we conducted a bibliometric study of the Scopus database over the last 10 years, between 2010 and 2019, focusing on keywords such as software, education, teaching, learning, sustainable development and their respective variations. A systematic review method was used in this work, which produced an initial result of 581 papers. Subsequently, it was filtered through the thematic area of Computer Science, obtaining 232 documents. Subsequently, it was filtered by the Sustainable Development and education keywords, additionally filtering by documents type articles and conference publications for a result of 186 documents that resulted in 116 publications with at least one citation and 70 publications with zero citations. The analysis was performed using the search results analysis tool provided by Scopus and, in addition, VOSViewer as a tool to build and visualize bibliometric networks. The differential contribution of this study lies in the filtering, organization and analysis of 186 publications that allows it to be a source of bibliometric information that is expected to be an instrument that helps to focus future research in the area of sustainable software development. Overall and in accordance with the bibliometric indicators taken into account in this work, it is generally concluded that the Latin American region has very low impact production in the study area, than the areas of software engineering with the highest volume of Research related to sustainable development are requirements engineering, software design and architecture.},

The term Cyber-Physical Space is used to identify physical spaces that are enriched by digital software and hardware components, such as RFID, IoT devices, NFC, and more. The applications we engineer are becoming more and more cyber-physical spaces related: think to indoor localization and positioning, to crowd management applications, to context-aware applications reacting to people in proximity. This talk will illustrate my team experience in the engineering of software for cyber-physical spaces applied to the tourism industry. I will use the UFFIZI Galleries crowd management project, as well as the Researcher Night application to illustrate the challenges and opportunities in the field. The CAPS modeling language for cyber-physical spaces engineering will be illustrated as well.},

  abstract={Code review is a sustainable software engineering practice to assure software quality. Presently it is performed by software engineers with the help of tool support, for instance, Gerrit and termed as Modern Code Review (MCR). It is a lightweight way to deal with distinguishing abandons from source code. Software engineer's efficiency while performing MCR activities is exposed to varying people related situational factors that impact the software engineer's sustainability. The literature lacks the identification of people related situational factors in MCR. For successful MCR results, there is a need to distinguish people concerning situational factors to enhance the productivity and competence of software engineers for their sustainability. Therefore, this investigation intends to recognize situational variables influencing the ability and efficiency of software engineers. The systematic methodology utilized for this examination is Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The study results reported 52 situational factors. The situational factors are assembled into four fundamental classifications such as team, team interaction, reviewer response and knowledge sharing. The grounded theory approach has been applied to get final unique list of people related situational factors and sub factors. The investigation will be useful for expert performing examination seeing situational factors as well as the sustainability of software engineers engaged with MCR activities.},

  title={Sustainability is Stratified: Toward a Better Theory of Sustainable Software Engineering}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1996-2008},
  abstract={Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or “pillars”-environmental, social, economic, technical and in-dividual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require refinement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identified. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from five article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratified (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly.},

  abstract={Integrating novel software systems in our society, economy, and environment can have far-reaching effects. As a result, software systems should be designed in such a way as to maintain or improve the sustainability of the socio-technical system of their destination. However, a paradigm shift is required to raise awareness of software professionals on the potential sustainability effects of software systems. While Requirements Engineering is considered the key to driving this change, requirements engineers lack the knowledge, experience and methodological support for doing so. This paper presents a question-based framework for raising awareness of the potential effects of software systems on sustainability, as the first step towards enabling the required paradigm shift. A feasibility study of the framework was carried out with two groups of computer science students. The results of the study indicate that the framework helps enable discussions about potential effects that software systems could have on sustainability.},

  abstract={Background: Supporting sustainability in software engineering is becoming an active area of research. We want to contribute the first Systematic Literature Review(SLR) in this field to aid researchers who are motivated to contribute to that topic by providing a body of knowledge as starting point, because we know from own experience, this search can be tedious and time consuming. Aim: We aim to provide an overview of different aspects of sustainability in software engineering research with regard to research activity, investigated topics, identified limitations, proposed approaches, used methods, available studies, and considered domains. Method: The applied method is a SLR in five reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [1]. We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.},

  abstract={We as software engineers are responsible for the long-term consequences of the systems we design—including impacts on the wider environmental and societal sustainability. However, the field lacks analytical tools for understanding these potential impacts while designing a system or for identifying opportunities for using software to bring about broader societal transformations. This article explores how the concept of leverage points can be used to make sustainability issues more tangible in system design. The example of software for transportation systems illustrates how leverage points can help software engineers map out and investigate the wider system in which the software resides, such that we can use software as an effective tool for engineering a more sustainable world.

  abstract={Nowadays, software is pervasive in our everyday lives. Its sustainability and environmental impact have become major factors to be considered in the development of software systems. Millennials-the newer generation of university students-are particularly keen to learn about and contribute to a more sustainable and green society. The need for training on green and sustainable topics in software engineering has been reflected in a number of recent studies. The goal of this paper is to get a first understanding of what is the current state of teaching sustainability in the software engineering community, what are the motivations behind the current state of teaching, and what can be done to improve it. To this end, we report the findings from a targeted survey of 33 academics on the presence of green and sustainable software engineering in higher education. The major findings from the collected data suggest that sustainability is under-represented in the curricula, while the current focus of teaching is on energy efficiency delivered through a fact-based approach. The reasons vary from lack of awareness, teaching material and suitable technologies, to the high effort required to teach sustainability. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators willing to teach sustainability in software engineering that can help to suit millennial students needs.},

  abstract={The intersection between software engineering research and the problems related to sustainability and green IT has been the subject of increasing attention. In spite of that, we observe that sustainability is still not clearly defined, or understood, in the field of software engineering. This lack of clarity leads to confusion about e.g. what is relevant to measure or the research implications over time or space. This paper provides an overview of how the research so far has defined sustainability, and how this definition has been used to guide which research areas. To this end, we carried out a systematic mapping study for selecting, classifying and analyzing relevant publications. In this study, we investigate which knowledge areas and which time scope of sustainability effects are mostly targeted in scientific research. Our analysis shows research trends and discusses gaps to be filled.},

  abstract={Sustainability management is one of the upcoming movements in the 21st century. Communal and private organizations are interested in finding and using "sustainable" solutions and practices. But, there is a lack of available solutions and practices. In the 21st century also, software systems and their underlying business processes are ubiquitous and fundamental for most of the organizations of the industrial society. But, until now, sustainability is not considered by software system engineering. Hence, to support the transition to sustainability, one must have sustainability (aspects) integrated into the software systems and the underlying business processes. Consequently, in this paper a holistic approach is presented to support the complete life cycle of sustainable software system engineering. To realize such an approach, the sustainable business processes and sustainable software systems need to be aligned through the mapping of sustainability aspects considering their respective life cycles. This is important because software makes an important contribution to sustainable business processes and, the other way round, sustainable software only can be developed and maintained using the relevant business processes. Moreover, to realize sustainability aware software system engineering sustainability aspects must be integrated into the business processes life cycle and software system engineering life cycle. To this end, We suggest a conceptual model to integrate sustainability aspects in a business process modeling language. Also, to assist the stakeholder when modeling, designing, executing, and monitoring the business processes a process model will be presented developed. Furthermore, to integrate sustainability aspects in software engineering, sustainability needs to be considered in the different phases of the software development process: requirements specification, design, testing, and maintenance. Thus, we suggest a method to integrate sustainability in software development. Finally, a model is presented showing the combined life cycles of sustainable business processes and sustainable software engineering.},

	abstract = {Sustainable manufacturing is an important goal to reduce the carbon footprint and securing the economic success of companies. To reach sustainable manufacturing it is also necessary to use sustainable equipment. For this purpose, the sustainability indicators of the asset during its whole life cycle need to be considered for decision making during the design and selection of equipment. Missing analysis methods as well as missing awareness of the importance are obstacles in decision making. Therefore, a multi-criterial analysis method for handling systems for decision empowerment is presented in this paper. The presented methodology enables the engineer to analyze the suppliers for decision making in the purchasing process as well as the identification of weak points regarding sustainability in the handling systems. The methodology offers the possibility of analyzing a system of several parts as a whole, rather than just individual parts. The methodology is implemented in a usable software prototype which has a graphical interface for the data input and can be connected to conventional databases. The usability of the tool is shown with a handling system consisting of an industrial robot and a gripping system.},

	abstract = {Titanium alloys play a crucial role in the advanced industries due to their high strength, resilience, rigidity, and low density, as well as their excellent corrosion resistance, which makes them suitable for a variety of engineering applications. Nonetheless, they have poor performance when machined. In this study, magnetic field diamond turning (MFDT) was used to increase the thermal conductivity and thus the machinability of machined Ti-6Al-4 V alloy parts, as well as the lifetime of the diamond cutting tool. The thermal properties of the work material under a magnetic field were investigated using ABAQUS software. The simulation results were validated by the cutting experiments, which demonstrated improved machining performance, increased tool life, and enhanced thermal properties of the machined parts. The surface morphology such as surface defects and surface roughness and microstructure modifications were investigated as evidence. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the MFDT on the machinability of titanium alloys as the thermal conductivity increases, resulting in increased tool life and improved machined surface quality reached to more than 60% for achieving sustainable diamond machining.},

@article{GOMES2023107240,
	abstract = {Context:
In the livestock domain, technologies are developed to sustainably raise animal production. However, the domain is critical, since animals are very sensitive to variables such as temperature and humidity, which can cause diseases and consequent production losses and discomfort. Livestock production systems then demand monitoring, reasoning, and acting on the environment so that the levels of those variables are preserved in pre-established intervals and undesired conditions are predicted, avoided, and mitigated with automated actions.
Objective:
The main contribution of this article is presenting E-SECO, a software ecosystem platform, and its evolution that encapsulates a new self-adaptive component to tackle animal production decisions, named e-Livestock architecture.
Method:
Two case studies were conducted involving a real system derived from the E-SECO platform encompassing a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place.
Results:
Results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract disruptive technologies based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence and accommodate them in a single architecture for that specific domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of a self-adaptive architecture to support engineering a complex system for a livestock sub-domain (milk production), and (iii) support empirical studies in a real smart farm towards a future transfer of technology to industry.
Conclusion:
The results showed that the E-SECO platform, which encompasses e-livestock architecture, can support monitoring, reasoning, prediction, and automated actions in a milk production/Compost Barn environment.},

	abstract = {The use of BIM in the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) industry is becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, interoperability with Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) remains a significant challenge in the domain. Furthermore, available applications require high expertise to correctly implement the data export, don't allow incremental database updates and are overall non-cost-effective, moreover in the case of small and medium-sized structures. At the same time, given the need to invest in a more sustainable built environment, it is necessary to consider the whole lifecycle of constructions, including the operation and maintenance phase, while designing. In the framework of this scenario, the paper presents a research work which defines a method to implement interoperability between BIM and CMMS software by using the IFC open standard, to allow an easier management of buildings, from design to decommissioning. This method, devised to be as feasible as possible, combines an operational procedure and a practical tool. The work was supported by the software house Prometeo Srl and the Facility Management company GEMMO SpA. The method was developed based on the Feltre Hospital (Italy) and results, that were technically validated through an ad hoc BIM model, can be used by other practitioners to further implement the method in other research.},

	abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering (AE), and Construction (AEC) industry is a sector in accepting change and adopting new technological approaches. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is increasingly adopted as the leading information technology tool emerging in the AEC industry. Thanks to its advantages, especially the generation of a virtual model centralising all the information concerning the different trades involved and the effective interoperability, BIM has greatly helped construction projects reach a mature performance level. However, some phases in the AE lack interoperability and information exchange efficiency. This inefficiency is much more critical in the case of design and structural projects. In this respect, this study aims to conduct and integrate BIM into an AE process to analyse and improve the degree of efficiency of a structural project. For this purpose, a real case study on a high-standing villa was conducted. The BIM process was implemented based on the spirit of collaboration and interoperability with both Revit{\textregistered} and Robot{\textregistered} software. The results describe the BIM process's ease of modelling, verification, transfer, exchange, and error detection. Thus, the speed, ease of modification, and decision-making. Thus, the rate of improvement and decision-making. The paper joins the body of studies seeking to reposition the AEC industry. It develops a Framework between Revit and Robot at the professional level, valid for all structural projects. For the scientific community, the study proposes innovation in AEC as a field of research to achieve the desired performance and sustainability. The work is limited to architecture and structural engineering and does not include MEP.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing companies are increasingly pushed towards more sustainable production by socio-political and environmental factors. In order to assess their sustainability performance, companies often use the widespread life cycle assessment (LCA) as defined by ISO 14040 and supported by various LCA software solutions. However, this is regularly associated with well-known shortcomings such as difficulties in gaining appropriate life cycle inventory data, lack of result transferability, and the amount of time needed for LCA studies. To overcome these problems, approaches for automating the LCA process have proven to be promising in other engineering disciplines (e.g., civil engineering). However, hardly any approaches to automating the LCA of manufacturing processes exist. Based on an extensive literature review, this paper presents a concept for an automated LCA of manufacturing processes. The approach consists of three steps and covers the phases of data extraction, LCA model building, and analysis. It is geared towards using implicitly existing manufacturing information and facilitating the so far mostly manual data collection and modeling processes. To conclude, an outlook is given on how the proposed concept will be further developed in an industrial setting.},

	abstract = {An innovative soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) slurry composed of cement, clay soil, bentonite and reactive high titanium slag (HTS) was synthesized to block the migration of contaminants in groundwater at tailings ponds. Mechanical activation was applied to activate the HTS, and partial cement was replaced by the reactive HTS. The engineering performance indices of the HTS-SCB slurry, such as the slump, hydraulic conductivity, compressive strength, porosity and leaching risks of heavy metals, were evaluated in this study. The hydration products were identified through a series of analytical tests. The three-dimensional microscale structure of the sample was obtained from the CT experiment, and the microscale geometrical properties were analysed using pore-network models and Avizo software. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was applied to simulate the fluid flow in the HTS-SCB slurry, and the simulated hydraulic conductivities and three-dimensional streamlines were obtained. The results showed that the HTS-SCB slurry had an optimal anti-seepage performance, appropriate mechanical performance and low leaching risks of heavy metals when the cement was replaced by 50 % reactive HTS. The hydration reaction between calcium hydroxide and HTS generates large amounts of fresh calcium silicate hydrates containing Fe and Ti, which fill the pores and contribute to low hydraulic conductivity, micropores (diameter ≤ 2.8 μm) and microflow paths (diameter ≤ 2.5 μm). The LBM results show that the calculated hydraulic conductivities match well with the measured values, and a high tortuosity is obtained from the three-dimensional velocity fields. The HTS-SCB slurry can satisfy the requirement of cut-off walls in land remediation applications and realize solid waste recycling, energy conservation and emission reduction and sustainable development.},

@article{FAGERHOLM2023107163,
	abstract = {Context:
Decision making pervades software and systems engineering. Intertemporal decisions involve trade-offs among outcomes at different points in time. They play a central role in systems design, as recognised since the inception of the software engineering (SE) field. They are also crucial for the sustainability of design decisions. However, temporal decision making is not adequately understood in SE. The field of Judgement and Decision Making (JDM) offers important empirical findings and research methods that could be utilised.
Objective:
This article establishes a baseline for studying how software professionals handle intertemporal choices. It examines how temporal distance affects choices in an example scenario, explores in what areas of software development such decisions can be found, and examines how systems design decisions can be characterised and studied as intertemporal.
Method:
We developed a method to study intertemporal choice in SE, based on an initial set of psychological theory grounded in JDM. We instantiated the method in a study to elicit responses to an intertemporal choice task followed by a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) interview.
Results:
We found that study participants overall tended to discount future outcomes, but individual participants varied wildly in how they valued present vs. future outcomes. They indicated several locations in which intertemporal choices occur in everyday software development. Based on these findings, and by reconciling our initial theory with existing JDM theory and results, we further developed and refined our theory and study method into a framework for studying intertemporal decision making in SE.
Conclusions:
To obtain a basis for more sustainable software systems design decisions, SE research should adopt a more comprehensive, detailed, and empirically consistent way of understanding and studying intertemporal choices. We provide suggestions for how future research could achieve practical methods that address essential characteristics of real-life systems design decisions.},

Indeed, the sustainability approach assists the economic analysis leading to appropriate combination methods. Concerning the energetic flow exhausting a solid oxide fuel cell system, this study proposes an innovative trigeneration process with high sustainability index utilizing three stages of sequential heat recovery. The process encompasses a two-stage Rankine cycle boosted by a thermoelectric generator and an ejector refrigeration unit, and a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. This system is simulated in engineering equation solver software and a comprehensive sensitivity study is accomplished. It is concluded that the most influential parameter in the whole framework is the operational temperature of the stack and in the integrated process is turbine 1 pressure. Afterward, an advanced evolutionary optimization method is employed using the MATLAB software, and the optimal point is designated from the sustainability and economic standpoints. The optimal state reveals the sustainability index of 2.61 and total unit cost of 35.93 $/GJ, improved by 12.5% and 3.8% against the base case, respectively. Besides, the electric power, cooling, and hydrogen are correspondingly produced at 389.4 kW, 112.4 kW, and 0.45 kg/h, resulting in exergy efficiency and exergoeconomic factor of 57.75% and 52.1%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Ti-6Al-4V alloy has widespread uses in a variety of engineering applications such as in the manufacturing of aerospace, automotive, and prosthetics body-parts owing to its unique characteristics. However, the machining of Ti-6Al-4V generates high cutting temperature due to poor thermal conductivity. This high cutting temperature triggers chemical reactivity of the alloy with the tool material and accelerates the edge wear. Therefore, the cryogenic coolants are used to improve the cutting performance, but their poor lubrication allows for high cutting forces. Hybrid lubri-coolants could be an alternative to reduce the temperature efficiently. The simulation of hybrid lubri-coolants by Finite Element Modeling (FEM) is an interesting to explore the high-performance cutting of hard titanium alloy. The current study compares the cutting temperatures using DEFORM{\textregistered} FEM simulations software and to foresee the cutting temperatures in milling Ti-6Al-4V at various levels of cutting speeds Vc (100--300 m/min), and feed per tooth fz 0.08--0.12 mm/z and under effect of hybrid lubri-coolants (ethanol, ester oil, and hybrid ethanol-ester oil). Initially, the 2D milling models were developed and predicted results were compared to milling experiments. The comparison of experimental and simulation cutting temperatures revealed a maximum of 6.5 % error. Thus, it can be concluded that 2D modeling is an effective tool to predict the milling temperatures within a reasonable error.},

	abstract = {The use of natural composites in modern engineering applications has numerous benefits owing to their excellent sustainable attributes and negligible environmental impacts. The full commercialization of natural composites as alternative materials to conventional ones is undermined by environmental factors such as moisture content leading to varied shrinkage and swelling behaviors. Uncontrolled shrinkage behavior can often lead to premature split in natural composites. The aim of this study is to investigate the fracture mechanisms due to directional shrinkage in natural composite material through numerical simulation by considering the finite element modelling software of LS-DYNA. From numerical results, directional shrinkage could be seen to clearly affect the fracture patterns in natural composites as compared to the control one. The fracture patterns, which indicated a narrowed region of stress concentration in the material, is assumed to emanate from internally induced forces in the material, namely tensile and compressive forces. This specific pattern is associated to longitudinal split failure typically observed in orthotropic materials. Results of this study can be useful to further investigate the complex fracture behavior in natural composite materials to better understand their durability limitations.},

	abstract = {The long-term creep behaviour of steel-reinforced concrete-filled steel tubular (SRCFST) column under whole life cycle is a key issue in engineering design. Therefore, a finite element (FE) analysis based on ABAQUS software is conducted to study the creep performance of SRCFST columns considering the initial stress of steel tube. Based on the verified FE model, the whole process load-deformation curves, load distributions of each component and longitudinal strain versus time curves are obtained. The stress distributions of each component are analyzed at the feature points. The effects of main parameters on the creep behaviour are studied, including the sustained load level, initial stress ratio, compressive strength of concrete, steel ratio of steel tube and encased steel section. The studies show that the SRCFST member exhibits an elastoplastic behaviour subjected to the coupling effect of initial stress on steel tube and sustained load. However, the creep ratio undergoes a change from linear to nonlinear by increasing long-term load or initial stress ratio. Finally, a method for calculating the creep in SRCFST columns under combined loads is provided, and the long-term performance can be better predicted.},

	abstract = {Bone tissue possesses piezoelectric properties, allowing mechanical forces to be converted into electrical potentials. Piezoelectricity has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in bone remodelling and adaptability. Bone remodelling models that consider strain adaptation, both with and without piezoelectric effects, were simulated and validated in this study. This simulation help to better comprehend the interplay between mechanical and electrical stimulations during these processes. This study aimed to optimise the modelling of piezoelectric effects in bone modelling analysis. The connection between mechanical loads applied to bones and the resulting electrical charges generated by the piezoelectric effect was examined. Furthermore, mathematical modelling and simulation techniques were employed to enhance the piezoelectric effect and promote bone tissue growth and repair. The findings from this research have substantial implications for developing novel therapies for bone-related diseases and injuries. It was observed that electrically stimulated bone surfaces increased bone deposition. In some instances of physical disability or osteoporosis, therapeutic electrical stimulation can supplement the mechanical stresses of regular exercise to prevent bone loss. Consequently, the bone remodelling method on the software platform enables easy application and repetition of finite element analysis. This study significantly benefits bone tissue/biomedical engineering, particularly in bone remodelling, healing, and repair.},

	abstract = {Context:
Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which are challenging to maintain, and evolve in response to changes in stakeholder requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability -- the capacity to endure in changing environments -- is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Objective:
The objective of the paper is to re-examine our previous assumptions and arguments in light of advances in the field. This reflection paper provides an opportunity to obtain new insights into the trends in software sustainability in both academia and industry, from a software architecture perspective specifically and software engineering more broadly. Given advances in research in the field, the increasing introduction of academic courses on different sustainability topics, and the engagement of companies to cope with sustainability goals, we reflect on advances and maturity about the role sustainability in general plays in today's society. More specifically, we revisit the trends, open issues and research challenges identified five years ago in our previous paper on software sustainability research and practice from a software architecture viewpoint, which aimed to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures in order to consider how this paper influenced and motivated research in the intervening years.
Method:
The forward snowballing method was used to establish the methodological basis for our reflection on the state of the art. A total of 234 studies were identified between April 2018 and June 2023 and 102 studies were found to be relevant according to the selection criteria. A further subset was mapped to the primary themes of the original paper including definitions and concepts, reference architectures, measures and metrics, and education.
Vision:
The vision of this reflection paper is to provide a new foundation and road map of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software engineering highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.},

	abstract = {In our current day and age, Earth suffers under the human ecological footprint, which influences our health and well-being. Technological solutions, including software-related ones, may help tackle these concerns for humanity. However, the development of such solutions requires special attention and effort to overcome human, public, and social barriers that might prevent them from being effective. The Requirements Engineering for Well-Being, Aging, and Health (REWBAH) workshop gathering in 2021 focused on addressing the challenge of how Requirements Engineering (RE) knowledge and practices can be applied to the development of information systems that support and promote long-lasting, sustained, and healthier behavior and choices by individuals. An interactive discussion among subject matter experts and practitioners participating in the REWBAH'21 revolved around several questions. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the emerging themes were arranged in the sustainable-health RE (SusHeRE) framework to describe RE processes that address both sustainability and health goals. In this vision paper, we present our framework, which includes four main SusHeRE goals defined according to the changes in RE that we deem necessary for achieving a positive contribution of RE on sustainability and health. These goals involve improved RE Techniques, Multidisciplinary Expertise, Education Agenda, and Public and Social Ecology.},

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing, commonly known as 3D Printing, is one of the most affordable manufacturing processes for producing complex geometric components. This manufacturing process is also frequently used when it is needed to manufacture unique parts to replace degraded or damaged components and spare parts that are no longer available. In this reverse engineering process, particular attention must be given to the constitutive models of materials. The 3D printing manufacturing process usually requires a change of materials and introduces or increases the anisotropy. In addition, the complexity of part geometries and loading often requires using the finite element method to simulate their behaviour in service. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the materials frequently used in 3D Printing for its sustainability, affordability, and mechanical and thermal properties. In this study, a bushing of a hinged drawer support is reverse-engineered, and its in-service behaviour is simulated before it is manufactured using Tough PLA material through 3D printing. Furthermore, the effect of the anisotropy and the friction in the design is evaluated. The MSC Patran/Nastran 2021 software for the finite element analysis, the Ultimaker Cura 5.0 software and the Ultimaker S5 printer were used.},

	abstract = {Waste-to-energy incineration is an effective and sustainable solution to reduce produced waste and simultaneously generates electricity utilizing thermal energy. The waste-to-electrical efficiency of conventional incineration plants is limited to 20--25% due to the higher amount of moisture content in the feedstock and flue gas heat losses. In addition, tubes of the incineration boiler are subjected to corrosion problems at elevated temperatures. In the present research, a parabolic trough solar-integrated municipal solid waste power plant is proposed and thermodynamically evaluated for different useful outputs. The solar energy is harvested through parabolic trough collectors to reheat the working fluid of the incineration plant to increase the steam temperature before it is fed to the low-pressure turbine. Meanwhile, a single-effect absorption chiller is integrated to utilize the thermal energy of the trough collectors for cooling purposes. In addition, the thermal energy of flue gas is used to power an organic Rankine cycle that further drives a proton exchange membrane and reverse osmosis desalination unit for hydrogen and freshwater production, respectively. In this way, the steam temperature for reheating the low-pressure turbine is increased to further improve the performance of the proposed solar-integrated waste-to-energy plant without causing any corrosion problems to the incineration boiler. The integrated facility is thermodynamically analyzed based on a 560-tons/day incineration plant using the engineering equation solver (EES) software. The results indicate that the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed plant are 32.51% and 23.7%, respectively, while the coefficient of performance of the absorption chiller is 0.849. Moreover, it is concluded that the produced desalinated water and hydrogen rates are 23.96 kg/s and 0.000857 kg/s, respectively.},

However, in the real decomposition of TPVA, the temperature in the oxidation reactor is not self-sustaining; as a result, the degradation products contain a lot of CO, resulting in more pollution and energy waste. In this paper, jet stirred reactor (JSR) and Chemkin software were used to study the reaction kinetics characteristics of the oxidation process of degradation products from TPVA in the range of 550 $\,^{\circ}$C--700 $\,^{\circ}$C. Both experiments and kinetic simulation show that a higher average temperature of the oxidation reactor is needed to achieve lower CO emissions. When using 5% or 10% TPVA degradation solution, the average temperature should not befall below 625 $\,^{\circ}$C or 675 $\,^{\circ}$C. The corresponding residence time should be greater than 6 s and 5 s respectively. The combination of research findings and engineering practice provides great help to the optimization of the actual work process.},

For this reason, this work aimed to conduct a scientometric analysis on the topic of cavitation for water and wastewater treatment during the last 20 years, from 2001 to August 2022. We focused on hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation as the prevalent methods of inducing cavitation. Furthermore, an in-depth study on the main trends regarding the number of publications and citations, keywords co-occurrence and evolution, and countries' publication trends was carried out to investigate the future direction of this research topic. The data was gathered from the Web of Science database and analyzed by the Visualization Of Similarities software. This work focused on: i) publication and citation trends, ii) scientific categories, iii) countries' contribution to the topic of cavitation, iv) prominent journals, v) keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis, and vi) keyword evolution analysis. Results showed a significant increase in publications during the past 5 years. The scientific categories with the highest number of publications were ``environmental sciences'' and ``environmental engineering,'' with a combined share of 19.4 % of publications. Keywords evolution analysis showed that limited focus was given to topics related to ``energy'' and ``energy efficiency'' in the field of cavitation, but with the rising importance of each process's sustainability, the attention given to these concepts will increase in the future. Future directions for the topic of cavitation-related water and wastewater treatments will shift towards more environmentally friendly applications of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation as well as towards more green and sustainable approaches to address the increasing water pollution problems and shortage. Moreover, it will include other uses besides water treatment such as manufacturing nanomaterials food production and medicine.},

The BIM model facilitated a 3D visualisation of the exposure in urban environments by exporting information to GIS software, which could then be visualised on Google Earth. The main advance of the developed methodology is its applicability to any urban environment for determining and reducing aerobiological health risks in civil engineering.},

	abstract = {Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) plays a key role in digital transformation demanded by Industry 4.0 and life cycle assessment, including sustainability assessment. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) applications can support PLM by integrating heterogeneous knowledge from different stages throughout the product life. However, the integration of knowledge from different stages and teams can cause misunderstanding if not represented in a unified form. Furthermore, different forms of knowledge used by different software are neither machine-readable nor human-readable, which also sets obstacles to knowledge integration in KBE applications. Supply chain sustainability assessment is such a scenario that entails integrating knowledge from different sources. This paper firstly implements a sustainability assessment method from other scholar to calculate the supply chain sustainability performance and adapts a sustainability assessment ontology for supply chain sustainability assessment. Then, an example KBE application is developed by implementing the sustainability assessment ontology and calculation method to simulate the knowledge sharing and integration between different teams. Finally, through this example application, it is discussed that the implementation of ontology to represent knowledge in PLM application for collaborative tasks like sustainability assessment can increase the efficiency of data sharing and integration. This paper is a proof of concept for the ontology-based framework. This framework can facilitate to represent knowledge but not create new knowledge, which means it can increase the efficiency of the software development, but cannot provide a better calculation method and assessment framework for supply chain sustainability assessment.},

This article explains the comparative advantages of Geosynthetic Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls over four other conventional types (Plain Concrete Gravity walls; Reinforced Concrete Cantilever walls; Masonry Brick walls; and Gabion Limestone Cage walls) from a sustainability perspective over various heights. The study comprises a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) following the ISO 14040 and 14044 frameworks. The results revealed that constructing MSE walls rather than the other conventional walls contributes to 10 of the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GaBi's software and embedded database were utilized for the first time in such an assessment. The article demonstrated that the construction of gravity walls requires large amounts of cement/concrete, which emit a significant amount of geogenic CO2. In contrast, the construction of MSE walls requires considerably less concrete and more backfill. The construction of cantilever walls requires less concrete than gravity, yet more than MSE walls for their construction. The structure of masonry walls was found to have less impact on the environment than the construction of comparable gravity and cantilever walls. The benefits of MSE walls over conventional walls increased with increasing wall height. The significant benefit comes from using soil backfill as the chief structural component rather than concrete. This article is deemed an essential step in achieving circularity and circular economy regarding sustainable earth fill retaining structures.},

A potential application of this conceptually designed system is for a community identified in the Tuscany region of Italy's Larderello field. The proposed system is then analyzed and assessed by utilizing sensitive the thermodynamic simulations and software. The effects of operational and state-related parameters, such as steam, oxygen, waste tire input rate, reference temperature, and gasifier temperature are examined to analyse and evaluate the integrated waste tire gasification system's performance. The present study further aims to determine the effects of varying system parameters and operating circumstances on the ethanol and hydrogen production rates, with the goal of increasing energy and exergy efficiencies while minimizing hazardous wastes and gas emissions. Furthermore, numerous parametric studies on the waste tire-powered multigeneration system are undertaken accordingly. Both Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Aspen Plus software packages are utilized as potential tools to perform analysis andsimulation studiesfor this system. The proposed system is fed with 10 kg/s of waste tires, and the energy production is supported by using 14.7 kg/s of geothermal spring water. While the net electricity generation, cooling and heating capacities of this system are obtained to be 18752 kW, 49236 kW and 5363 kW, respectively, while the total hydrogen and ethanol production rates within the integrated system are found to be 3.02 kg/s and 0.13 kg/s. The results also show that the waste tire-based integrated gasification system's overall energetic and exergetic efficiencies become 71.45 % and 69.87 %, respectively.},

The current system is simulated using the Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS. The thermodynamic calculations are carried out by using the engineering equation solver (EES) software package. This system primarily uses solar energy to produce electricity and as an input energy to the pyrolysis reactor that converts plastic wastes to syngas. Also, the system includes a thermal storage unit to maintain the operation during low solar irradiation. The syngas produced from plastic wastes pyrolysis is processed through a combined cycle to produce electricity. The system generates the electricity at a capacity of 21,601.9 kW. The methane produced is processed through a steam reforming unit to produce hydrogen at a total rate of 0.6 kg/s. The water desalination sub-system produces fresh water through multi effect desalination at a rate of 22.95 kg/s.

To explore the potential of this solution, the synergistic effect of bio-ethanol and spark-induced compression ignition (SICI) combustion with reliance on efficient supervisory control systems is evaluated for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. This article is pioneered with the forward engineering of SICI combustion engine for plug-in hybrid biofuel-electric vehicles (PHBEVs) by optimizing the high-efficiency region of SICI combustion system for the PHBEV with dynamic programming (DP)-based case studies, after which the DHE prototype is produced using one-dimension and three-dimension engine digital twin models. Further, experimental test data of the optimized DHE is used to model the PHBEV in GT-Suite and MATLAB/Simulink software, and its charge-sustaining (CS) performance with rule-based control and adaptive equivalent minimization control strategy (A-ECMS) under both homologation and real-world driving cycles is evaluated and compared with the offline DP. The results show that the SICI combustion engine-based PHBEV with ethanol blending from E20 to E100 can reduce the well-to-wheel (WTW) CO2 emissions by 28% to 75%, respectively, where more than 7% of the reduction is contributed by control system optimization using A-ECMS. Moreover, the digital twin-based simulation platform developed in this work can be applied to evaluate and optimize the advanced combustion engines and supervisory controllers for hybrid biofuel-electric vehicles.},

Whereas the application of the FAIR principles as a guideline to provide all collected data with rich metadata that allow for finding, accessing, interoperating with and reusing the data effectively is constantly growing within science and research, the usage in an industrial scenario is largely unexplored. Today, collected industrial data is often stored in arbitrary data formats without appropriate metadata describing the data content and is therefore lost for future reuse because crucial information on how to find, access and interoperate with the data is missing. Moreover, insufficiently described or missing data can lead to wrong decisions.

While the discussion on how to operationalize the new intelligent systems of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is still going on; the dominant characteristics of the fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 -- going beyond producing goods and services for profit -- requires all to think and act differently. As a result of the convergence phenomenon, the boundaries between different disciplines are eroding, necessitating a thorough discussion on what engineering education should be like in the future. In this paper, after presenting a brief history of engineering education, the recent paradigm changes are discussed, which essentially stress that skills must prevail over degrees to deal with challenges posed by the trends of the fifth industrial revolution.

More specifically, we highlight the need for a systems approach where model-based sustainable process synthesis, design, and analysis serve as opportunities to tackle the challenges. Three technology areas (interlinked to each other) that impact the sustainability of earth, namely, chemical processes linked with CO2 capture and utilization, biorefineries and water desalination are selected to highlight our views as well as the need for further development of computer-aided tools to efficiently solve the large and complex mathematical systems the problems represent. Analysis of these problems and their reported solutions indicate that opportunity exists for development of a new class of model-based methods and tools and their integration with the currently available ones to obtain the desired sustainability development goals.},

	abstract = {In lightweight design, developers are used to face the conflicting objectives of functional fulfillment, economic performance, and sustainability. Against this background, however, a clearly structured approach for the satisfied use of specific lightweight engineering methods within the product development is still missing. Thus, this contribution deals with the fundamental conception and first implementation of a systematic development methodology covering the disciplines of mechanics, electrics/electronics and software just like the focus on an integrated view on product, production and material aspects. To ensure an application-specific manifestation of the product development process for three exemplary use cases from small and medium-sized enterprises but also large corporations in the area of prosthetics, bike construction and plant engineering, the individually developed methods and tools are first generalized in order to make them adaptable to a wide variety of industries. As a result, one lightweight-specific method or tool (e.g., function mass analysis, ``PPM solution correlator`` or ``2D layout & weight drafting'') is introduced in more detail for all stages of the technically extended RFL(T)P approach derived from model-based systems engineering (MBSE).},

	abstract = {Context:
Technical excellence is a nebulous term in agile software development. This vagueness is risky because it may lead to misunderstandings and to agile implementations that may overlook a key principle of agile development.
Objective:
This study investigates how agile practitioners interpret the concept of technical excellence brought up in Principle 9 of the Agile manifesto. Moreover, we investigate how agile practitioners put the concept into practice and what conditions facilitate putting technical excellence into practice.
Methods:
We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty agile practitioners, coded the data inductively, and performed two sessions to validate the emerging findings.
Results:
We find that technical excellence is first and foremost a mindset that is underpinned by continuous attention to sustainable code, continuous learning, and teamwork. Fostering technical excellence requires the adoption of design and development practices, such as continuous architecting, and is supported by continuous learning. We also identify three enabling conditions for technical excellence: Leadership support, customer buy-in, and psychological safety. These enablers provide teams with leeway to nurture their pursuit of technical excellence.
Conclusion:
Our findings highlight the key role of people-based strategies in promoting technical excellence in agile software development. They show that the attainment of technical excellence does not only involve technical practices. On the contrary, it relies on social and organizational support and, most importantly, a mindset.},

In light of the ecological crises and the tremendous impact of digital systems on reshaping economic and social arrangements - often with negative side-effects - we need a sustainability transformation of the digital transformation. However, this is a complex and long-term task. In this article we combine an analysis of accountability arrangements in software engineering and a model of sustainability transformations to trace how certain dynamics are starting to make software engineering accountable for sustainability in the technological, cultural, economic and governance domains. The article discusses existing approaches for sustainable software engineering and software engineering for sustainability, traces emerging discourses that connect digitalization and sustainability, highlights new digital business models that may support sustainability and shows governance efforts to highlight ``green and digital'' policy problems. Yet, we argue that these are so far niche dynamics and that a sustainability transformation requires a collective and long-lasting effort to engender systemic changes. The goal should be to create varied accountability arrangements for sustainability in software engineering which is embedded in complex ways in society and economy.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a Microsoft Excel tool to calculate liquid-gas mass transfer coefficients in packed towers to support numerical design activities in the courses of Unit Operations for Industrial Process and Sustainable Process Design for the Master's degree in Chemical Engineering of the University of Naples Federico II (Italy). The Mass Transfer Solver Tool (MT Solver Tool) uses several available models to estimate, separately, the values of liquid and gas mass-transfer coefficients and the wet surface area for 144 random and structured packings of interest for absorption/stripping and distillation processes. In addition, a separate spreadsheet can be used in a user-defined mode, to evaluate the mass transfer coefficients with new packing types or to interpret experimental data when the geometrical and physical characteristics of the packing are known. Eventually, the tool is supplied with a data library, where packing geometry and model fitting parameters can be retrieved. The software is aimed to support students and educators in the Unit Operations for Industrial Process and Sustainable Process Design courses. In particular, this is meant to be an example on how the accuracy of design algorithms adopted in unit operation processes is affected by the use of the underpinning correlations for mass transfer rate or pressure drops. Besides, this is aimed to encourage comparison of different correlations when exact field data are not available. Besides, chemical engineers and researchers interested in packed columns design and modelling data may also benefit from the utilization of the software. The MT Solver Tool was introduced to students in a dedicated tutorial lesson after lecturers on packed column design algorithms for distillation, absorption and stripping. Most of the students of the course participated to a group training aimed to simulate the design of an absorption column supported by the MT Solver Tool providing feedback on its application. After the training, an anonymous survey was proposed to the students to monitor the approval rating of the proposed activity and the use of the MT Solver Tool software to support numerical calculations.},

	abstract = {The presented engineering discipline one-off construction is characterized by a multiplicity of manual processes. As almost all modern product developments, the manufacture is based on the creation and consistent use of digital models. Quality of underlying data can vary greatly and it is not certain that digital models match the actual state of construction. This can result in the need for rework after production or installation. Especially challenging in the area of premium products, for which high quality, scarce materials are used and tight schedules are defined. If physical products are reworked, the corresponding digital models must be manually maintained. At present, attempts are being made to counteract these late adjustments by means of physical mock-ups or visual inspection of 3D scan data. Such scan data is used for automated adaptation of underlying digital models to the actual state of the physical construction. Existing Point Cloud Library functionalities were adapted and further algorithms were designed. The developed software backend was integrated into the existing software architecture. During the software development, great care was taken to ensure that the backend is based on open source content. The results show significant improvements of the data basis for the subsequent engineering activities. This will lead to a significant reduction of manual effort and rework, ensuring development cycles and even shorten delivery times. It reduces costs in the product creation process and sustainably strengthens confidence in digital models used. It has been shown that automation of design processes can have productivity-enhancing effects in one-off construction.},

	abstract = {Paper deals in-depth with the topic of sustained stress indices applicable to 90$\,^{\circ}$ elbows based on non-linear finite element analysis models. A comprehensive overview of the existing literature sources is given in the first part of the paper, showing that there are little sources which deal specifically with this topic and that the ones that do exist result in important scatter of the results. As a result, more than few of the existing sources are non-conservative in their nature. Dedicated non-linear finite element studies have been performed on shell and solid models which are used in conjunction with the regression analysis in order to obtain explicit equations which can be used to calculate both in- and out-plane sustained stress indices in 90$\,^{\circ}$ pipe elbows, which can then be used in the typical pipe stress analysis. Newly proposed equations prove to be a good fit for the numerical data, showing little deviation as shown by the correlation parameters presented in the paper. Final part of the paper presents a dedicated section on the high wall thickness elbows and shows the relationship between elbow wall thickness and maximum stress location. It is shown that beyond certain thickness, the maximum stress location shifts from the typical failure location (i.e., side wall) to the locations which are not typically expected (i.e., intrados or even away from elbow). This shifting may have an important effect on the theoretical models which assume failure location.},

	abstract = {Robot-centric automation solutions (RAS) promise greater efficiency and consistent quality in production, relieving workers of physically demanding and dangerous tasks, especially in the times of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to their relatively high complexity and implementation costs, RAS are only used to a limited extent by small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. As a rule, the high costs of RAS arise from custom engineering efforts, which take up to 70 percent of the acquisition costs. For this reason, it is necessary to optimise the engineering of RAS. However, software tools such as configurators have been used primarily for the individualisation of products, such as automobiles or clothing, based on variants predefined by the manufacturer, and less for the engineering of automation solutions. The development of knowledge-based systems, in particular knowledge-based engineering configurators (EC), is usually performed by few proficient experts with high development effort. One of the primary challenges in the knowledge acquisition is that several experts possess partial aspects of knowledge in an inhomogeneous, implicit form. Furthermore, there is a lack of efficient development methods for EC. By reusing knowledge elements from previous development projects, a sustainable increase in efficiency is possible. In order to enable an efficient development process of EC, we introduce a structuring model consisting of four knowledge domains (KD): knowledge about specific business cases (KD1), Best Practices as case-specific solution knowledge (KD2), logical expert knowledge (KD3) as well as semantically consistent data models for interoperability of different IT systems (KD4). As the four KD are independent, their development can be agilely divided among several teams or companies. Finally, the agile development approach is validated individually for each KD as well as comprehensively within the scope of the ROBOTOP platform for planning RAS.},

Owing to the critical role of software-intensive systems in society, software engineers have the accountability to consider sustainability as a goal while structuring a software system. However, there are no practical guidelines providing a tangible decomposition of the sustainability aspect. Moreover, there are limited quantifiable methods to support sustainable design and analysis.
Objectives:
The purpose of this study is to help software practitioners to take sustainability into account by providing systematic guidelines for the software engineering process. We propose a framework that presents a meta model to decompose sustainability requirements and an assessment approach to evaluate sustainability achievements.
Method:
This work presents an integrated framework that combines a goal-based approach, scenario-based approach, and feature modeling to gather sustainability related requirements and corresponding features. For sustainability assessment, software analysis and machine learning techniques are utilized to analyze software products based on sustainability metrics and criteria.
Results and Conclusions:
The empirical study conducted with participants from academia and industry revealed that the proposed framework improves participant's ability to consider sustainability aspect in their software engineering tasks through focusing on requirements, design, and evaluation. With the provided sustainability meta-model, the participants could extract more stakeholders, requirements, and features in shorter time. Moreover, the empirical study result also demonstrated that this study is capable to indicate specific scenarios that should be redesigned to improve the sustainability achievements level.},

@article{SCHAFFER2021207,
	abstract = {Digitization within the framework of Industry 4.0 is considered the biggest and fastest driver of change in history of manufacturing industry. While the size of a company is becoming less essential, the ability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and new technologies is more important than ever. This trend particularly applies to the companies' software landscapes, where individual sub-processes and services must be orchestrated, seamlessly integrated, and iteratively renewed according to the ever-increasing user requirements. However, inflexible, closed monolithic software applications as well as self-programmed stand-alone tools that are difficult to integrate are still predominant in the engineering domain. A complete reimplementation of existing, proprietary engineering tools and their integration into monolithic applications of large software providers is often not economically feasible, especially for small and medium-sized machinery and plant manufacturers. In this context, the so-called Process-Driven Approach (PDA) offers a sustainable and tool-neutral opportunity for process and tool orchestration, enabling an easy integration of individual software applications by consistent utilization of the separation of concerns principle. The PDA, originating from business informatics, is mainly based on the standardized and machine-executable visual modeling language Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Using the semantic enhancements found in version 2.0, BPMN is not just used to model the business processes but also to model and execute the integration processes between different systems. After the PDA has already been successfully applied to large-scale projects in business informatics, it is now being transferred to the engineering domain. As shown in this paper, PDA allows to orchestrate the different processes in engineering and to integrate the underlying software tools, such as e-mail or spreadsheet applications, engineering tools, or custom microservices, using standardized interfaces like REST API. In doing so, engineering processes can be made more transparent, monitored, and optimized by means of appropriate key figures. The concept is validated by a prototypical implementation of a minimum functional PDA architecture for the engineering domain.},

	abstract = {Sustainability has become a major focus of the cement industry, largely due to the carbon dioxide emissions associated with Portland cement production. In grouting engineering, ordinary cement slurry has high viscosity, poor fluidity and groutability and is prone to blockage. In this study, a cement slurry was designed using superfine cement (SC). Fine-grained ultrafine fly ash (UFA) waste was used, part of which is used to replace cement, and a certain amount of nontoxic mSiO2·nH2O (SH) is extracted from limestone waste and mixed with the commonly used admixture polycarboxylic acid water reducer (PAWR) to ensure its physical properties in practical engineering applications while reducing its viscosity, increasing its fluidity, and reducing the occurrence of clogging. To determine the optimal mix ratio of the cement slurries mixed with various materials, the characteristics of each material were analyzed through the single-factor test of the multiperformance test, and the orthogonal test mix ratio was designed based on the single-factor test results. Through the Taguchi grey correlation analysis method, the orthogonal test data were analyzed to find the optimal mix ratio. A performance test of the cement slurry with the optimal mix ratio was carried out, and its sustainability was analyzed. Combined with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Voronoi Calculation Method (VCM) methods, UDEC numerical simulation software is used to simulate and analyze the general laws of cement slurry fluidity. The results show that the cement slurry with the optimal mix ratio of SH, SC, PAWR and UFA materials has good fluidity and groutability, has the characteristics of sustainable development, and can be applied to practical projects.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for a sustainable Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has driven research domains integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) with sustainability to gain momentum over the past years. While some studies have reviewed the development in these two domains separately, they did not address the important associations between them, nor did they analyze their joint advancement over time. Therefore, this study aims to understand and quantitatively analyze the dynamic evolution of relationships between BIM and sustainability critical towards developing BIM's functionalities to satisfy the industry's growing sustainability needs. First, 523 relevant journal articles published over the last 15 years were collected. Rule-based content analysis is then conducted on these articles using text mining to retrieve and structure relevant textual data pertaining to the six defined dimensions: BIM functionalities, software, sustainability aspects, green certification systems, project phases, and stakeholders. Social network theory is then applied to map and measure the associations between the dimensions' components for analyzing the dynamic changes in their synergies over three spans. Results reveal a significant transformation in the diversity, magnitude, and expansion of associations between BIM and sustainability domains across the supply chain. Findings also highlight less explored areas that require further research and industrial attention towards achieving full use of BIM and sustainability's integrated power. This work's novelty lies in comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing these often-dismissed synergies to reveal through knowledge-based findings how BIM has progressed to address the industry's changing sustainability requirements and recommend future directions for advancing sustainable BIM practices.},

On this front, and from a sustainability improvement perspective, the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) capabilities could represent an opportunity to improve these impacts in all steps of a building's life. The main purpose of the current paper is to identify the areas in which BIM technology can or already is playing a role in improving building efficiency, helping AECO sector stakeholders in reducing environmental impacts. In the current paper, the impact of using BIM to enhance the building energy efficiency is explored through a scientometric analysis and a systematic literature review. There is a high interest among the scientific community in these fields, given the recent rise in publications and citation numbers. Moreover, there is a lack of interoperability between BIM and energy analysis tools, a high potential for integrating BIM with other technologies, such as thermography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and monitoring, and a very positive impact from the use of BIM in the optimisation of construction solutions which allow energy savings in the AECO sector.},

	abstract = {The software industry has become increasingly competitive as we see multiple software serving the same domain and striving for customers. To that end, modern software needs to provide creative features to improve sustainability. To advance software creativity, research has proposed several techniques, including multi-day workshops involving experienced requirements analysts, and semi-automated tools to support creative thinking in a limited scope. Such approaches are either useful only for software with already rich issue tracking systems, or require substantial engagement from analysts with creative minds. In a recent work, we have demonstrated a novel framework that is beneficial for both novel and existing software and allows end-to-end automation promoting creativity. The framework reuses requirements from similar software freely available online, utilizes advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, and leverages the concept of requirement boilerplate to generate candidate creative requirements. An application of our framework on software domains: Antivirus, Web Browser, and File Sharing followed by a human subject evaluation have shown promising results. In this invited extension, we present further analysis for our research questions and report an additional evaluation by human subjects. The results exhibit the framework's ability in generating creative features even for a relatively matured application domain, such as Web Browser, and provoking creative thinking among developers irrespective of their experience levels.},

	abstract = {This study presents a fuzzy logical decision-making algorithm based on block theory to effectively determine discontinuous rock slope reliability under various wedge and planar slip scenarios. The algorithm was developed to provide rapid response operations without the need for extensive quantitative stability evaluations based on the rock slope sustainability ratio. The fuzzy key-block analysis method utilises a weighted rational decision (multi-criteria decision-making) function to prepare the `degree of reliability (degree of stability-instability contingency)' for slopes as implemented through the Mathematica software package. The central and analyst core of the proposed algorithm is provided as based on discontinuity network geometrical uncertainties and hierarchical decision-making. This algorithm uses block theory principles to proceed to rock block classification, movable blocks and key-block identifications under ambiguous terms which investigates the sustainability ratio with accurate, quick and appropriate decisions especially for novice engineers in the context of discontinuous rock slope stability analysis. The method with very high precision and speed has particular matches with the existing procedures and has the potential to be utilised as a continuous decision-making system for discrete parameters and to minimise the need to apply common practises. In order to justify the algorithm, a number of discontinuous rock mass slopes were considered as examples. In addition, the SWedge, RocPlane softwares and expert assignments (25-member specialist team) were utilised for verification of the applied algorithm which led to a conclusion that the algorithm was successful in providing rational decision-making.},

	abstract = {The multiple-unit sustained-release (MUSR) dosage forms containing numerous sustained-release subunits present a reliable choice for oral formulation of controlled release systems. As a typical MUSR, the metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablet is an advanced system with limited researches devoted to relating its structure to the drug release phase other than the preparation process and modulation to the release behaviors. This research details a three-dimension method to image the internal structure and detail drug release features of commercial metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets and component individual single pellets. As such, a new perspective for MUSR dosage form is provided. Using high energy synchrotron radiation X-ray microcomputed tomography (SR-μCT), the in-situ structure parameters were obtained nondestructively. It was demonstrated that the average number of spherical pellets in a tablet was 853 $\pm$ 12 (n = 3). The average volume of the pellets was 0.09 $\pm$ 0.01 mm3, the diameter was 0.55 $\pm$ 0.03 mm, and the sphericity was 0.87 $\pm$ 0.06. These data reflected the numerical features of pellets in MUSR tablets, which were helpful for reverse engineering to MUSR. Based on the three dimensional model generated by image processing and analysis software, the pellet structures were divided into three layers of typical depot sustained release system: pellet core, drug-containing layer and outer film. The dynamic structural features determined refer to the changes of structures in pellets during in vitro drug release, with evidence that the coating layer on the pellets maintained a spherical morphology whilst numerous valleys appeared on the surface. The material constitution and distribution in coating layer were evaluated by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared mapping and results indicated a composition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose dispersed in ethyl cellulose. Knowledge of these structural characteristics confirmed that the mechanism of sustained drug release was membrane controlled and consistent with the drug release profiles. In conclusion, the structural investigation provided knowledge of the intrinsic quality of metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets and offers guidance for reverse engineering of MUSR.},

	abstract = {Currently, there are limited techniques for non-experts to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and software tools developed by industry and academia for assessing each aspect of product sustainability performance. Moreover, the variety of available methods and software tools makes it challenging for non-experts to identify the most appropriate analysis option. This research aims to assist non-experts in selecting the most appropriate set of analysis methods and software tools prior to conducting sustainable engineering analysis (SEA) based on life cycle data accessible to them. A questionnaire-based ranking methodology is developed for non-experts, which reduces their time investment in examining the myriad SEA methods and tools and avoids non-value added effort. The questionnaire uses an interaction matrix within a general mathematical modeling approach to map a given set of methods and tools to user responses. Relevance weights are integrated within the matrix to rank available environmental, economic, and social assessment methods and tools for user consideration. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, a pilot project was conducted to improve the design of a hexacopter. Results were compared using lower- and higher-fidelity software tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the relevance weights assigned to each tool. Assigned weights were determined to enable differentiation between low and high fidelity methods and tools, but as new methods and tools enter into use, these weights must be updated. The process of selecting SEA methods and software gives insight into the utility of the interaction matrix implemented within the tool developed in this research. Moreover, non-experts can compare various design alternatives using the selected analysis methods and software tools to arrive at a solution with improved sustainability performance.},

This is especially important for cyber-physical systems where power consumption strongly influences the battery life. For this reason, software developers should be more aware of the energy consumed by their systems. Moreover, software systems should be developed to adapt their behavior to minimize the energy consumed during their execution. This can be done by monitoring the usage context of the system and having runtime support to react to those changes that impact the energy footprint negatively. Although both the hardware and the software parts of cyber-physical systems can be adapted to reduce its energy consumption, this paper focuses on software adaptation. Concretely, the paper illustrates how to address the problem of developing context-aware energy-efficient applications using a Green Eco-Assistant that makes use of advanced software engineering methods, such as Dynamic Software Product Lines and Separation of Concerns. The main steps of our approach are illustrated by applying them to a cyber-physical system case study.},

Using the example of the web-based configuration platform, it is finally shown how a MS architecture contributes to better development and easier deployment of engineering software solutions based on the divide and conquer principle.},

	abstract = {Recent growth in chemical engineering student numbers has driven an increase in the number of UK universities offering the subject. The implications of this growth are described, along with the different challenges facing new providers in the UK compared with established departments. The approaches taken by the various new entrants are reviewed, with reference to recruitment strategies, infrastructure, the use of external facilities, and the particular flavours of chemical engineering being offered by the new providers. Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes.},

Data sharing is a critical element of interoperability of models and other digital artifacts supporting the systems engineering process. Achieving interoperability within systems engineering requires eliminating differences of syntax and semantics to take advantage of automation, augmentation, and artificial intelligence capabilities that will increase process efficiency and artifact quality. This paper describes the development of a process-centric Systems Engineering (SE) reference ontology, based upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 Systems and Software Engineering -- Life Cycle Processes [1]. The proposed SE reference ontology extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is a very small top-level ontology (TLO) designed specifically to support the integration of more specific ontologies that extend from it [2]. A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon.},

	abstract = {Context
Software-intensive space systems can harbor defects and vulnerabilities that may enable external adversaries or malicious insiders to disrupt or disable system functions, risking mission compromise or loss. Mitigating this risk demands a sustained focus on the security and resiliency of the system architecture including software, hardware, and other components.
Objective
In this paper we offer methodical approaches for improving space system resiliency through software architecture design, system engineering, and increased software security, thereby reducing the risk of latent software defects and vulnerabilities.
Method
We conducted a systematic review of existing architectural practices, standards, security and coding practices, various threats, defects, and vulnerabilities that impact space systems from hundreds of relevant publications and interviews of subject matter experts. We expanded on the system-level body of knowledge for resiliency and identified a new software architecture framework and acquisition methodology to improve the resiliency of space systems from a software perspective with an emphasis on the early phases of the systems engineering life cycle. This methodology involves seven steps: 1) Define technical resiliency requirements, 1a) Identify standards/policy for software resiliency, 2) Develop a request for proposal (RFP)/statement of work (SOW) for resilient space systems software, 3) Define software resiliency goals for space systems, 4) Establish software resiliency quality attributes, 5) Perform architectural tradeoffs and identify risks, 6) Conduct architecture assessments as part of the procurement process, and 7) Ascertain space system software architecture resiliency metrics.
Results
Data illustrates that software vulnerabilities can lead to opportunities for malicious cyber activities, which could degrade the space mission capability for its user community. Reducing the number of vulnerabilities by improving architecture and software system engineering practices can contribute to making space systems more resilient.
Conclusion
Since cyber-attacks [1] are enabled by shortfalls in software, robust software engineering practices and an architectural design are foundational to resiliency, which is a quality that allows the system to take a hit to a critical component and recover in a known, bounded, and generally acceptable period of time. To achieve software resiliency for space systems, acquirers and suppliers must identify relevant factors and systems engineering practices to apply across the life cycle, in software requirements analysis, architecture development, design, implementation, verification and validation, and maintenance phases.},

	abstract = {Background
Since sustainability became a challenge in software engineering, researchers mainly from requirements engineering and software architecture communities have contributed to defining the basis of the notion of sustainability-aware software.
Problem
Despite these valuable efforts, the assessment and design based on the notion of sustainability as a software quality is still poorly understood. There is no consensus on which sustainability requirements should be considered.
Aim and Method
To fill this gap, a survey was designed with a double objective: i) determine to which extent quality requirements contribute to the sustainability of software-intensive systems; and ii) identify direct dependencies among the sustainability dimensions. The survey involved different target audiences (e.g. software architects, ICT practitioners with expertise in Sustainability). We evaluated the perceived importance/relevance of each sustainability dimension, and the perceived usefulness of exploiting a sustainability model in different software engineering activities.
Results
Most respondents considered modifiability as relevant for addressing both technical and environmental sustainability. Functional correctness, availability, modifiability, interoperability and recoverability favor positively the endurability of software systems. This study has also identified security, satisfaction, and freedom from risk as very good contributors to social sustainability. Satisfaction was also considered by the respondents as a good contributor to economic sustainability.},

It has boosted the integration of sustainable, sound practices across different fields (e.g. e-participation, smart transportation, sustainable agriculture). Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have strongly supported social transitions in becoming more sustainable and participative over the last two decades. Integrating multi-disciplinary sustainability concepts into the higher education of computer scientists is important in that this ensures that future ICT endeavours will take sustainability concerns into account. This article describes four capstone projects developed by students from the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Pervasive Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM), who were enrolled alongside regular students in a traditional software engineering course held at the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The coursework was part of a research project called Green.Citizen@ICT, which aims at investigating the use of ICT and software services for infusing sustainable habits in citizens through the development of applications for SD. This study demonstrates how a sustainable development focus can be integrated into a traditional software engineering course. The goal of this article is to enhance understanding of the integration of sustainability into software engineering education, by providing a detailed example of a master course in which this took place. This course supported the development of ICT competences for building cleaner, greener, and more resource- and energy-efficient cyber-physical systems, while addressing the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Context
Software producing organizations have the ability to address the energy impact of their software products through their source code and software architecture. In spite of that, the focus often remains on hardware aspects, which limits the contribution of software towards energy efficient ICT solutions.
Objective
No methods exist to provide software architects information about the energy consumption of the different components in their software product. The objective of this paper is to bring software producing organizations in control of this qualitative aspect of their software.
Method
To achieve the objective, we developed the StEP Method to systematically investigate the effects of software units through the use of software stubs in relation to energy concerns. To evaluate the proposed method, an experiment involving three different versions of a commercial software product has been conducted. In the experiment, two versions of a software product were stubbed according to stakeholder concerns and stressed according to a test case, whilst energy consumption measurements were performed. The method provided guidance for the experiment and all activities were documented for future purposes.
Results
Comparing energy consumption differences across versions unraveled the energy consumption related to the products' core functionality. Using the energy profile, stakeholders could identify the major energy consuming elements and prioritize software engineering efforts to maximize impact.
Conclusions
We introduce the StEP Method and demonstrate its applicability in an industrial setting. The method identified energy hotspots and thereby improved the control stakeholders have over the sustainability of a software product. Despite promising results, several concerns are identified that require further attention to improve the method. For instance, we recommend the investigation of software operation data to determine, and possibly automatically create, stubs.},

Our approach calculates similarity to a description of the feature to locate, occurrences where the candidate features remain unchanged, and changes performed to the candidate features throughout the retrospective of the product family. We evaluated our approach in two long-living industrial domains: a model-based family of firmwares for induction hobs that was developed over more than 15 years, and a model-based family of PLC software to control trains that was developed over more than 25 years.

The paper proposes a method to provide a measure, especially to the IT organizations to find how the information leakage at one portion of the software can propagate leakage risk to the other portions of the software or entire software. The paper uses the quantitative analysis of information leakage and cost function based statistical method to find the leakage risk propagation in the software. The method proposed in the paper facilitates the organizations by allowing them to set the organization specific parameters. The proposed method has been applied to the function of Linux to demonstrate the information leakage risk propagation. When organizations find information leakage in the software, their sustaining engineering or quality management teams simply rectify the software portion. But it becomes difficult for the organizations to document the overall mitigation of the risk of leakage. Thus, using the proposed method, organizations will be able to quantify the information leakage risk mitigation.},

	abstract = {Context
A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners.
Method
We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015.
Results
We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems.
Conclusion
SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.},

The paper aims to discuss these issues, focusing on the energy efficient refurbishment on two university campuses in Milan, Italy. A Methodology for Energy Efficient Building Refurbishment (MEEBR) has been identified and tested on two case studies with students of the Integrated Design Refurbishment Laboratory of Building Engineering Faculty at POLIMI. In particular, the performance energy analyses were conducted on two university building case: the first at POLIMI campus, and the second located in the Universit{\`a} degli Studi di Milano (UNIMI) campus. These analyses were carried out using numerical simulations, considering the increasing important role which software are playing in refurbishment building design process also in early design phase. This preliminary experience with students on MEEBR application, with also the overview on building refurbishment methodologies, show that case study examples can help to: increase consideration of the integrated research approach and improve sustainability performance in historical buildings taking into account also the user's participation of a university campus. The comparison of the energy assessment methodology, of the two software used for the analyses (CENED+ and Sefaira), leads to the statement that it is essential from the beginning, selecting a program in function of the particular job and the outputs that you want to reach with the tool.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of information technologies and the diversity of problem domains that heavily rely on software tool applications promote computer-supported cooperative work as a challenging discipline that drives the development process of contemporary and future engineering methods, standards, and tools. Consequently, a particular domain of expertise in engineering and scientific fields has emerged, demanding more advanced skills and deeper domain knowledge. The essential role of Architectural Design (AD) and Urban Planning (UP) is to enable a forward-looking approach to building/facility creation. Construction Engineering (CE) expresses its routine primarily through a transition phase that transforms ideas to sustainable urban artifacts. The CE role appears as a combination of backward and downward looking to the same process/product. All three domains are highly cooperative in the context of Environmental Engineering (EE). Currently available software tools that support the AD, UP and CE domains are far from simple. Several recent software engineering studies suggest that, instead of developing a complex ``all in one solution'', the federation or orchestration of several related simple methods and tools seems promising. In this article, we discuss the basic AD, UP and CE domain-cooperation aspects and suggest an Extensible Orchestration Framework (ExOF) model that may support them. To verify the ExOF simulation and orchestration potential, we used its architectural model to orchestrate different software tools when performing the urban blocks daylight illumination simulation for different urban block morphology models. For the exact simulation, we used the normalized sun-exposition data for the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. Also presented is an illustration of the methodology, modeling and orchestration potential of ExOF for the selected case study, together with the results, obtained for typical 3D models of selected urban block morphology patterns.},

@article{DITTRICH20141436,
	abstract = {Context
The main part of software engineering methods, tools and technologies has developed around projects as the central organisational form of software development. A project organisation depends on clear bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time. What happens when these conditions are not given? The article claims that this is the case for software product specific ecosystems. As software is increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of customisable and configurable products, software engineering as a discipline needs to take on the challenge to support software ecosystems.
Objective
The article provides a holistic understanding of the observed and reported practices as a starting point to device specific support for the development in software ecosystems.
Method
A qualitative interview study was designed based on previous long-term ethnographical inspired research.
Results
The analysis results in a set of common features of product development and evolution despite differences in size, kind of software and business models. Design is distributed and needs to be coordinated across heterogeneous design constituencies that, together with the software, build a product specific socio-technical ecosystem. The technical design has to support the deference of part of the development not only to 3rd-party developers but also to local designers tailoring the software in the use organisation. The technical interfaces that separate the work of different design constituencies are contested and need to be maintained permanently. Development takes place as cycles within cycles -- overlaying development cycles with different rhythms to accommodate different evolution drivers.
Conclusion
The reported practices challenge some of the very core assumptions of traditional software engineering, but makes perfect sense, considering that the frame of reference for product development is not a project but continuous innovation across the respective ecosystem. The article provides a number of concrete points for further research.},

The services will focus on improving the performance of products in operation taking into account different knowledge based aspects as reliability, availability, maintainability, costs, productivity, quality, energy efficiency, environmental impact, working environment, etc. In this regard, and having as a reference an industry driven Business Case focused on the windmill sector, the approach followed by EPES to generate and develop high added value services to support the windmill farms maintenance will be discussed. The capabilities resulting from the research will enable the capitalization on trustable global and local Sustainability Intelligence. Product engineering teams will be able to exploit this intelligence to adapt design, operation and disposal strategies through managed ``eco-constraints'' relevant to their market contexts.},

	abstract = {There is a growing class of engineering applications for which long-term managed evolution and/or managed sustainability is the primary development objective. The underlying tenet of our work is that neither of these trends will become fully mature without: (1) An understanding for how and why system entities are connected together, and (2) Formal procedures for assessing the correctness of system operations, estimating system performance, and understanding trade spaces involving competing design criteria. To address these concerns, during the past few years we have developed methodologies and tools for ontology-enabled traceability; that is, traceability mechanisms where requirements are connected to models of engineering entities by threading the traceability connection through one or more ontologies. In our proof-of-concept work the engineering entities were restricted to elements of system structure. But, of course, real engineering systems also have behaviors. This paper will report on research to understand the role that software patterns (e.g., model-view-controller) and mixtures of graph and tree visualization can play in the implementation of traceability mechanisms from requirements to elements of finite-state machine behavior (e.g., actions, states, transitions and guard conditions). We will present a simple lamp example.},

Although many policies in China have been issued to promote construction waste management, unfortunately there is no significant effect, and the key is lack of a quantitative evaluation system and guidance on management level. Based on the domestic and foreign relevant experiences, this paper puts forward a new system to evaluate waste management performance in an architectural engineering project. Through research, main influence factors of construction waste management in our country are confirmed, namely: ``commitment of contractor's representative on site; collecting packed materials back by suppliers; minimizing rework in the construction phase; design and construction using standardized materials; and appointment of laborers solely for waste disposal''. Through four construction cases in the Pearl River Delta with the application of performance assessment model of waste management in architectural engineering projects, it is proved that the model can effectively measure the waste management performance in construction site, with clearer responsibilities and higher performance. Finally, it is suggested that our government should assess waste management performance in construction site pertinently, develop market assessment software actively, and promote the environmental sustainable development of architectural industry.},

	abstract = {Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or ``pillars''-environmental, social, economic, technical and in-dividual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require refinement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identified. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from five article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratified (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly.},

	abstract = {Background: Software development is a knowledge-intensive and creative activity requiring human ingenuity, thus, sustainability from an engineer's perspective (i.e., meeting an engineer's personal and professional needs while maintaining their mental and physical well-being) must be achieved and maintained. Aims: With this paper, we aim to bring attention to the currently overlooked aspect of sustainability from an individual engineer's perspective. Method: Through an analysis of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies, this research demonstrates a lack of research investigating the individual (human) dimension of sustainability in the current software engineering literature. Results: The analysis of the literature reviews reveals that the current research has mainly focused on reducing the energy footprint of software systems. Thus, revealing the renewed need for paying attention to the individual engineer's perspective. Conclusion: Future research should leverage contributions from related research areas like human aspects in software engineering (e.g., topics like cognition and motivation). There is a need for identifying factors that impact sustainability at an individual level and their interplay with the team and organization level practices, policies, and decisions. The overall ambition is to develop empirically validated guidelines and best practices to measure, improve and maintain sustainability from an engineer's perspective. Such measures are expected to ensure engineers' sustainability and enable highquality software development.},

The term Cyber-Physical Space is used to identify physical spaces that are enriched by digital software and hardware components, such as RFID, IoT devices, NFC, and more. The applications we engineer are becoming more and more cyber-physical spaces related: think to indoor localization and positioning, to crowd management applications, to context-aware applications reacting to people in proximity. This talk will illustrate my team experience in the engineering of software for cyber-physical spaces applied to the tourism industry. I will use the UFFIZI Galleries crowd management project, as well as the Researcher Night application to illustrate the challenges and opportunities in the field. The CAPS modeling language for cyber-physical spaces engineering will be illustrated as well.},

	abstract = {Sustainability and environmental impact are important factors to consider in the software industry and especially in the training of the professionals who produce it. The non-renewable and increasingly limited resources of our planet generate the need to train engineers in the software area to assume their responsibility for sustainable development. Progress should be made in the inclusion of sustainable development principles in the curricula in the training of future software engineers. This article presents an analysis and monitoring of scientific publications, using bibliometric indicators in order to obtain and provide information on current research trends in the training of professionals in the area of software engineering with principles of sustainable development. For this reason, we conducted a bibliometric study of the Scopus database over the last 10 years, between 2010 and 2019, focusing on keywords such as software, education, teaching, learning, sustainable development and their respective variations. A systematic review method was used in this work, which produced an initial result of 581 papers. Subsequently, it was filtered through the thematic area of Computer Science, obtaining 232 documents. Subsequently, it was filtered by the Sustainable Development and education keywords, additionally filtering by documents type articles and conference publications for a result of 186 documents that resulted in 116 publications with at least one citation and 70 publications with zero citations. The analysis was performed using the search results analysis tool provided by Scopus and, in addition, VOSViewer as a tool to build and visualize bibliometric networks. The differential contribution of this study lies in the filtering, organization and analysis of 186 publications that allows it to be a source of bibliometric information that is expected to be an instrument that helps to focus future research in the area of sustainable software development. Overall and in accordance with the bibliometric indicators taken into account in this work, it is generally concluded that the Latin American region has very low impact production in the study area, than the areas of software engineering with the highest volume of Research related to sustainable development are requirements engineering, software design and architecture.},

	abstract = {Code review is a sustainable software engineering practice to assure software quality. Presently it is performed by software engineers with the help of tool support, for instance, Gerrit and termed as Modern Code Review (MCR). It is a lightweight way to deal with distinguishing abandons from source code. Software engineer's efficiency while performing MCR activities is exposed to varying people related situational factors that impact the software engineer's sustainability. The literature lacks the identification of people related situational factors in MCR. For successful MCR results, there is a need to distinguish people concerning situational factors to enhance the productivity and competence of software engineers for their sustainability. Therefore, this investigation intends to recognize situational variables influencing the ability and efficiency of software engineers. The systematic methodology utilized for this examination is Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The study results reported 52 situational factors. The situational factors are assembled into four fundamental classifications such as team, team interaction, reviewer response and knowledge sharing. The grounded theory approach has been applied to get final unique list of people related situational factors and sub factors. The investigation will be useful for expert performing examination seeing situational factors as well as the sustainability of software engineers engaged with MCR activities.},

	abstract = {Integrating novel software systems in our society, economy, and environment can have far-reaching effects. As a result, software systems should be designed in such a way as to maintain or improve the sustainability of the socio-technical system of their destination. However, a paradigm shift is required to raise awareness of software professionals on the potential sustainability effects of software systems. While Requirements Engineering is considered the key to driving this change, requirements engineers lack the knowledge, experience and methodological support for doing so. This paper presents a question-based framework for raising awareness of the potential effects of software systems on sustainability, as the first step towards enabling the required paradigm shift. A feasibility study of the framework was carried out with two groups of computer science students. The results of the study indicate that the framework helps enable discussions about potential effects that software systems could have on sustainability.},

	abstract = {Software is now a vital scientific instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent 'reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers - the people actively developing software in an academic research environment - subjectively define software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.},

Millennials-the newer generation of university students-are particularly keen to learn about and contribute to a more sustainable and green society. The need for training on green and sustainable topics in software engineering has been reflected in a number of recent studies. The goal of this paper is to get a first understanding of what is the current state of teaching sustainability in the software engineering community, what are the motivations behind the current state of teaching, and what can be done to improve it. To this end, we report the findings from a targeted survey of 33 academics on the presence of green and sustainable software engineering in higher education. The major findings from the collected data suggest that sustainability is under-represented in the curricula, while the current focus of teaching is on energy efficiency delivered through a fact-based approach. The reasons vary from lack of awareness, teaching material and suitable technologies, to the high effort required to teach sustainability. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators willing to teach sustainability in software engineering that can help to suit millennial students needs.},

	abstract = {Sustainability management is one of the upcoming movements in the 21st century. Communal and private organizations are interested in finding and using "sustainable" solutions and practices. But, there is a lack of available solutions and practices. In the 21st century also, software systems and their underlying business processes are ubiquitous and fundamental for most of the organizations of the industrial society. But, until now, sustainability is not considered by software system engineering. Hence, to support the transition to sustainability, one must have sustainability (aspects) integrated into the software systems and the underlying business processes. Consequently, in this paper a holistic approach is presented to support the complete life cycle of sustainable software system engineering. To realize such an approach, the sustainable business processes and sustainable software systems need to be aligned through the mapping of sustainability aspects considering their respective life cycles. This is important because software makes an important contribution to sustainable business processes and, the other way round, sustainable software only can be developed and maintained using the relevant business processes. Moreover, to realize sustainability aware software system engineering sustainability aspects must be integrated into the business processes life cycle and software system engineering life cycle. To this end, We suggest a conceptual model to integrate sustainability aspects in a business process modeling language. Also, to assist the stakeholder when modeling, designing, executing, and monitoring the business processes a process model will be presented developed. Furthermore, to integrate sustainability aspects in software engineering, sustainability needs to be considered in the different phases of the software development process: requirements specification, design, testing, and maintenance. Thus, we suggest a method to integrate sustainability in software development. Finally, a model is presented showing the combined life cycles of sustainable business processes and sustainable software engineering.},

	abstract = {Ten years ago, it was usual that projects in the software industry ran on for years before the customer was able to lay his hands on the product he had ordered. This often resulted in delays, budget overruns and disappointing deliverables. During the last decade, the Agile approach has been taking over software project management, shortening product development cycles from a few years to a few weeks or even days. Recently, the agile approach has even been used for developing a new car which runs 100 miles per gallon [1]. Several recent surveys [2], [3] show that agile methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming or Kanban have successfully been adopted by many companies to develop software. However, agile methodologies do not come for free. A different set of skills, or agile practices as they are called, are necessary for the software engineers in order to be able to sucessfully deliver high-quality software at the end of every iteration. The same surveys show that only few of the agile practices are used and even fewer are applied consequently and thoroughly. This is to a great extent due to the lack of skilled software engineers. Although teaching agile software development has drawn some attention in recent research, we do not yet seem to be able to ``deliver'' the appropriately skilled engineers. What is the reason for this, and more importantly, how can we improve the situation? In this position paper we propose a more holistic approach for teaching agile software engineering, in which the required agile practices and values are not only integrated theoretically but also practically applied and repeated until they become a habit to students and software engineers.},

	abstract = {Background: Supporting sustainability in software engineering is becoming an active area of research. We want to contribute the first Systematic Literature Review(SLR) in this field to aid researchers who are motivated to contribute to that topic by providing a body of knowledge as starting point, because we know from own experience, this search can be tedious and time consuming. Aim: We aim to provide an overview of different aspects of sustainability in software engineering research with regard to research activity, investigated topics, identified limitations, proposed approaches, used methods, available studies, and considered domains. Method: The applied method is a SLR in five reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [1]. We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.},

	abstract = {Sustainability is becoming an important topic in IT - as contribution of IT to safeguard our future, and as evolving market segment. IT's high productivity in combination with short life cycles and, on the other hand, growing resource problems of our planet, lead to a necessity that software engineers take their share of responsibility for sustainability. Therefore, we need to include the concept of sustainability into the university curriculum of computer science. The challenge is to motivate and interest students (and lecturers) for sustainability, to identify spheres of activity for software engineers, to build up competence fields for solutions, and to incorporate the topic into the syllabus. This paper presents a strategy for integrating the concept of sustainability into a degree course scheme across three stages: find a core of interested people by offering a seminar, then broaden the awareness for sustainability by offering a lecture series, and finally establish the topic by offering teach-the-teacher seminars and integration into software engineering lectures.},

This hierarchical decomposition has a profound influence on evolvability, maintainability and work assignment. Hierarchical decomposition is thus clearly of central concern for empirical software engineering researchers; but it also poses a quandary. At what level do we study phenomena, such as quality, distribution, collaboration and productivity? At the level of files? packages? or modules? How does the level of study affect the truth, meaning, and relevance of the findings? In other fields it has been found that choosing the wrong level might lead to misleading or fallacious results. Choosing a proper level, for study, is thus vitally important for empirical software engineering research; but this issue hasn't thus far been explicitly investigated. We describe the related idea of ecological inference and ecological fallacy from sociology and epidemiology, and explore its relevance to empirical software engineering; we also present some case studies, using defect and process data from 18 open source projects to illustrate the risks of modeling at an aggregation level in the context of defect prediction, as well as in hypothesis testing.},

Several studies have addressed the impact of sustainability in the SE practice, from a range of perspectives. This study presents a systematic mapping study that aggregates, summarizes and discusses the state-of-the-art approaches for sustainable SE practice. We analyzed 75 relevant primary studies addressing methods, processes, tools and metrics proposed to support the software development in a sustainable way. The included primary studies were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to studies published prior to 2017. They were analyzed based on a set of classification criteria, including contribution types, SDLC phases, evidence types, research types, application domains, publication venues, distribution between academia and industry and research methods. The results indicated a growing interest by the SE research community in the Green and Sustainable software domain. Besides, there is an observed need for more studies on techniques, tools and metrics covering construction, testing and maintenance. The results also point out a clear view of the SE community about the need for a better alignment between research and practice in this domain.},

Consequently, Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S) has developed as an active area of research. Objective/Aim: Though SE4S gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions, there is only one rigorous survey of the field. We follow up on this systematic mapping study from 2012 with a more in-depth overview of the status of research, as most work has been conducted in the last 4 years. Method: The applied method is a systematic mapping study through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas are most explored, and which research type facets have been used, to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art in SE4S. Results: We contribute an overview of current research topics and trends, and their distribution according to the research type facet and the application domains. Furthermore, we aggregate the topics into clusters and list proposed and used methods, frameworks, and tools. Conclusion: The research map shows that impact currently is limited to few knowledge areas and there is need for a future roadmap to fill the gaps.},

In the software engineering field, the topic has received increasing attention in recent years, with several studies addressing a range of concerns. However, few studies have demonstrated the awareness of software practitioners about the underlying concepts of sustainability in the software development practice. In this effect, in this study, we aim to provide some evidence about the practitioners' perception about the adoption of sustainability in software development, under four main perspectives: economic, social, environmental and technical. To accomplish such a goal, we carried out a survey study with twenty-five software engineers involved in projects in different domains. The yielded results indicate an overall lack of knowledge about the topic, in particular regarding the concepts about sustainable software, although it is a common understanding that sustainability should be treated as a quality attribute and should support the interaction between sustainability and the software development life cycle phases. Among the observed perspectives, the respondents indicate that the technical dimension is the most relevant and explored so far. This study contributes to the field with initial evidence and can be seen as a first step towards establishing a common understanding about how the software industry is receptive to the use of sustainability concepts in software development practices.},

While greening by software aims at saving energy (or other resources) by the help of software, greening in software aims at reducing the environmental impact caused by the software itself.The "Green In Software Engineering, Green By Software Engineering" (GIBSE) workshop aims to bring together academic and industrial researchers to share their experience in achieving the green-ness in and by software.

	abstract = {Software systems across various application domains are undergoing a major shift, from static systems of systems to dynamic ecosystems characterized by largely autonomous software agents, engaging in mutual coalitions and partnerships to complete complex collaborative tasks. One of the key challenges facing software engineering along with this shift, is our preparedness to leverage the concept of mutual trust building among the dynamic system components, to support safe collaborations with (possibly malicious or misbehaving) components outside the boundaries of our control. To support safe evolution towards dynamic software ecosystems, this paper examines the current progress in the research on trust in software engineering across various application domains. To this end, it presents a survey of existing work in this area, and suggests the directions in which further research is needed. These directions include the research of social metrics supporting trust assessment, fine-grained quantification of trust-assessment results, and opening the discussion on governance mechanisms responsible for trust-score management and propagation across the integrated software ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Software Engineering is a crucial discipline present in several undergraduate courses, often due to the incorporation in its curriculum and many times focusing only in technical artifacts analysis, which leads to restricting social and business aspects, and limiting a global vision. Software Ecosystem (SECO) is a collection of software products with some degree of symbiotic relationship, consisting of a set of actors working as a unit interacting with a market distributed between software and services, along with the relationships between these entities. Motivated by the SECO diffusion, the idea of incorporating its teaching in the Software Engineering discipline seems to be attractive. However, a drawback to SECO research is the lack of modeling support. Furthermore, there is a need for more examples of SECO models, mainly close to the students' reality. This work aims to report the teaching of SECO in the Software Engineering discipline. For this, a qualitative analysis of a questionnaire with students' answers was designed. As a result of this work, we concluded that adding the teaching of ECOS in the Software Engineering discipline provides a global view of the systems development, mainly social aspects and evolution.},

	abstract = {Context: Two of the most common external threats to validity in quantitative studies in software engineering (SE) are concerned with defining the population by convenience and nonrandom sampling assignment. Although these limitations can be reduced by increasing the number of replications and aggregating their results, the acquired evidence rarely can be generalized to the field.Objective: To investigate the state of practice of meta-analysis in SE and its limitations, intending to propose an alternative perspective to understand the relationships among experimentation, production, threats to validity and evidence. To propose and evaluate means to strengthen quantitative studies in software engineering and making them less risky due to population and sampling issues.Method: To use the underlying idea from the Theory of Food Chains to alternatively understand the impact of external threats to validity in the SE experimental cycle (experimental chains). Next, to accomplish an initial technical literature survey to observe basic features of secondary studies aggregating primary studies results. Third, to organize a set of experimental chain's concepts and make initial discussions regarding the observed secondary studies concerned with this metaphor.Results: By applying the experimental chains concepts it was initially observed that, although important and necessary, most of the current effort in the conduction of quantitative studies in SE does not produce (mainly due to population/sampling constraints) results strong enough to positively impact the engineering of software. It promotes an imbalance between research and practice. However, more investigation is necessary to support this claim.Conclusion: We argue that research energy has been lost in SE studies due to population/sampling constraints. Therefore, we believe more investigation must be undertaken to understand how better organizing, enlarging, setting up and sampling SE quantitative studies' population by using, for instance, alternative technologies such as social networks or other crowdsourcing technologies.},

	abstract = {The treatment of economic and social issues in Software Engineering (SE) was pointed out as a challenge for the next years, since SE needs to treat issues beyond the technical side, which requires observing it in another perspective. In this sense, this paper revisits the concept of components in SE through a sociotechnical construction. Based on a ranking of its critical elements, a study shows that components are assets in a set of collaborative/local environments more than in global/corporate markets. So, an approach called Brech\'{o}-VCM was proposed to treat some of these elements, providing an environment to discuss the future of Software Reuse on a software ecosystem perspective. These analyses, as well as their results, reinforce that SE community needs to learn with the components case and effectively looks at SE future in a sociotechnical way.},

	abstract = {Systems-of-systems (SoS) have become increasingly complex and frequently used in highly distributed, dynamic, and open environments. SoS refer to evolving software systems in which constituent systems (themselves systems in their own right) cooperatively work to fulfill specific, complex missions, facing Software Engineering researchers and practitioners with substantial challenges. Software ecosystems (SECO) have also become an important research topic, addressing social issues along with technical aspects of software development. SoS and SECO are closely related and naturally distributed in development teams. In both fields, distributed resources aim at reducing cost and reaching new Information Technology markets. Software Engineering-related problems and challenges are amplified and become more critical when SoS and SECO are analyzed together. The 10th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS 2022) celebrates a decade of promoting a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, analyze research and development issues, discuss promising solutions, and propose theoretical foundations for the development and evolution of complex software-intensive systems, inspiring visions for the future of Software Engineering for SoS and SECO, as well as paving the way for a more structured community effort. Based on the community feedback, topics of interest should address systems thinking and complexity of those types of systems. As such, the SESoS community is reflecting on how the different dimensions of those types of systems - technological, organizational, and social - should be addressed in research and practice.},

	abstract = {Sustainability has become an important concern across many disciplines, and software systems play an increasingly central role in addressing it. However, teaching students from software engineering and related disciplines to effectively act in this space requires interdisciplinary courses that combines the concept of sustainability with software engineering practice and principles. Yet, presently little guidance exist on which subjects and materials to cover in such courses and how, combined with a lack of reusable learning objects. This paper describes a summer school course on Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S). We provide a blueprint for this course, in the hope that it can help the community develop a shared approach and methods to teaching SE4S. Practical lessons learned from delivery of this course are also reported here, and could help iterate over the course materials, structure, and guidance for future improvements. The course blueprint, availability of used materials and report of the study results make this course viable for replication and further improvement.},

	abstract = {Software engineers are plagued by the same troubles as many others in highly skilled jobs and digitized environments: Ever-expanding to-do lists, time to market pressure from management, deadline-driven development, continuous interruption during working tasks, and the juggle of balancing that with other areas of life (physical, mental and emotional health, family, household, finance, friends, hobbies and community service). These demands of life in combination with a seemingly ever-increasing pace wear or burn out many people in the long run. Specifically, as software engineers, this also leads to decreased creativity and less efficiency in problem-solving. Generally offered solutions are reducing screen time and spending more time outdoors, both of which are hard to do within the work of a software engineer. On a meta level, if the developers of the systems that run most of our world do not develop individual sustainability with a balanced pace of life, that imbalance propagates into the systems we develop (similar to Conway's Law). We argue that mindfulness practices like yoga poses (asanas), breathing practices, and meditation exercises can help individually, and even more effectively in combination. In this exploratory paper, we discuss related work that explores the application of these mitigations in other application domains and propose a research agenda to explore their use within software engineering education and practice.Engaging with mindfulness practices in the context of software engineering promises to enhance creativity and cognitive problem-solving skills, leading to more efficiency and effectiveness during software development and increased individual sustainability. This, in turn, leads to better team spirit as well as increased economic profit, both in terms of maintaining human capital and customer contract deliverables.},

Efforts must be made to create and maintain such sustainable manufacturing systems. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) in combination with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) system can be utilized to evaluate a manufacturing system performance taking into account environmental measures before actual construction or use of the manufacturing system. In this paper, we present a case study to show how DES can be utilized to generate requirements specification for manufacturing systems in the early stages of the design phase. Requirement specification denotes the description of the behavior of the system to be developed. The case study incorporates use of LCA data in combination with DES. Data for the model in the case study is partly provided through the format supported by the Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) standardization effort. The case study develops a prototype paint shop model, and incorporates alternate decisions on energy use, choice of machines, and environmental bottleneck detection. The study results indicate the potential use of utilizing DES in combination with LCA data to generate requirements specification for designing sustainable manufacturing systems.},

	abstract = {In software ecosystems (SECO), requirements engineering (RE) activities and process require the collaboration of several stakeholders such as requirements engineers, users, third-party developers, collaborators etc. Therefore, it is a highly human-dependent process. Identifying how human and social factors can influence RE-related activities and process would improve RE in SECO. In this context, this study aims to identify which human and social factors influence RE activities in SECO. To do, we conducted a rapid review, supplemented with the snowballing technique to retrieve published studies. A total of 673 studies were returned, of which 12 were included and analyzed from three research questions that provided us with an understanding of the human and social factors of RE in SECO. The results indicate that decision making, multiple actors, geographic distance/time, and negotiation skills are important human and social factors when involved in RE activities in SECO. Finally, the results of this study can help practitioners and researchers define mechanisms to enhance the positive and decrease the negative influence of these factors.},

	abstract = {Switching off network links/nodes for energy efficiency is no longer a new thing to the Internet community but the important thing is its dynamic deployment. Up until now, the normal paradigm in energy aware traffic engineering is to deploy a pruned network topology based on historic traffic matrices or to manipulate, on the fly, the traffic routings based on some network metrics. However, these schemes could be inimical to the diurnal traffic. We therefore propose an Energy Saving Scheme (ESS) that is based on the current network traffic and is not limited to the off-peak period for its operation. It employs the principle of using only links whose sleeping/wake-up operation are non-disruptive during peak periods. Using the publicly accessible traffic traces of both GEANT and Abilene networks respectively, our results show a substantial amount of energy-savings in both peak and off-peak periods. More importantly, by deploying a non-disruptive approach during the peak period, we show that green traffic engineering does not have to be limited in its operational mode.},

	abstract = {The popularization of cloud computing brings emergency concern to the energy consumption in big data centers. Besides the servers, the energy consumed by the network in a data center is also considerable. Existing works for improving the network energy efficiency are mainly focused on traffic engineering, i.e., consolidating flows and switching off unnecessary devices, which fails to comprehensively consider the unique features in data centers. In this paper, we advocate a joint optimization for achieving energy efficiency of data center networks by proposing a unified optimization framework. In this framework, we consider to take advantage of the application characteristics and topology features, and to integrate virtual machine assignment and traffic engineering. Under this framework, we then devise two efficient algorithms, TE VMA and TER, for assigning virtual machines and routing traffic flows respectively. Knowing the ncommunication patterns of the applications, the TE VMA algorithm is purposeful and can generate desirable traffic conditions for the next-step routing optimization. The TER algorithm makes full use of the hierarchical feature of the topology and is conducted on the multipath routing protocol. The performance of the overall framework is confirmed by both theoretical analysis and simulation results, where up to 50% total energy savings can be achieved, 20% more compared with traffic engineering only approaches.},

This paper presents the results of a qualitative study exploring requirements engineering practitioners' perceptions and attitudes towards sustainability. It identifies obstacles and mitigation strategies regarding the application of sustainability design principles in daily work life. The results of this study reveal several factors that can prevent sustainability design from becoming a first class citizen in software engineering: software practitioners tend to have a narrow understanding of the concept of sustainability; organizations show limited awareness of its potential opportunities and benefits; and the norms in the discipline are not conducive to sustainable outcomes. These findings suggest the need for focused efforts in sustainability education, but also a need to rethink professional norms and practices.},

	abstract = {Context: It is impossible to imagine our everyday and professional lives without software. Consequently, software products, especially socio-technical systems, have more or less obvious impacts on almost all areas of our society. For this purpose, a group of scientists worldwide has developed the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF) which examines the impacts on five interrelated dimensions: social, individual, environmental, economic, and technical. According to this framework, we should design software to maintain or improve the Sustainability Impacts. Designing for sustainability is a major challenge that can profoundly change the field of activity -- particular for Software Engineers. Objectives: The aim of the thesis work is to analyze the current role of Software Engineers and relate it to Sustainability Impacts of Software Products in order to contribute to this paradigm shift. This should provide a basis for follow-up works. The question in which direction exactly the Software Engineer should develop and how exactly this path can be followed is still owed by the scientific community. Perhaps universities will have to adapt the curriculum in the training of Software Engineers, politics could possibly initiate support programs in the field of sustainability for software companies, or maybe software sustainability certifications could emerge. In any case, Software Engineers must adapt to the times and acquire the necessary knowledge, the skills and the competencies. Results: The results of the dissertation are a better understanding of the needed paradigm shift of Software Engineers and complement the SusAF that to better support sustainability design. The extended SusAF is intended for both training and corporate use.},

The stakeholders of GSS are detailed with the services each stakeholder can provide and consume, thus clarifying their interests to GSS. Based on this analysis, we present the domain-independent, high-level requirements to GSS that cover diverse needs of different stakeholders. Six business models are then proposed to promote collaborations of stakeholders on the delivery of GSS. In the end, the relationship between GSS and cloud is discussed and a GSS marketplace is envisioned.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces GREEN STREAMS, a novel solution to address a critical but often overlooked property of data-intensive software: energy efficiency. GREEN STREAMS is built around two key insights into data-intensive software. First, energy consumption of data-intensive software is strongly correlated to data volume and data processing, both of which are naturally abstracted in the stream programming paradigm; Second, energy efficiency can be improved if the data processing components of a stream program coordinate in a ``balanced'' way, much like an assembly line that runs most efficiently when participating workers coordinate their pace. GREEN STREAMS adopts a standard stream programming model, and applies Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to coordinate the pace of data processing among components, ultimately achieving energy efficiency without degrading performance in a parallel processing environment. At the core of GREEN STREAMS is a novel constraint-based inference to abstract the intrinsic relationships of data flow rates inside a stream program, that uses linear programming to minimize the frequencies -- hence the energy consumption -- for processing components while still maintaining the maximum output data flow rate. The core algorithm of GREEN STREAMS is formalized, and its optimality is established. The effectiveness of GREEN STREAMS is evaluated on top of the StreamIt framework, and preliminary results show the approach can save CPU energy by an average of 28% with a 7% performance improvement.},

	abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) comprises the practice of systematically using models during software development. The high diversity of MDE assets (e.g., metamodels, models, model transformation engines, and design tools) has raised a rich, diverse, and complex software ecosystem (SECO), where a collection of assets is governed by underlying rules and surrounded by a community of players. The lack of a deeper understanding on those relations has: (i) hampered the adoption of such paradigm by newcomers; (ii) increased the learning curve; (iii) prevented the community from exploiting their full potential; and (iv) inhibited the more essential benefits promoted by MDE, such as automation, reuse, productivity, maintainability, and time to market. In this context, this paper presents preliminary results of an investigation on MDE as a SECO. We compiled existing knowledge from literature joining independent research findings to provide an exploratory characterization of the technical dimension of such ecosystem. We also identified research gaps that motivate further investigation considering the relevance and potential of this topic for the forthcoming years.},

	abstract = {With the explosive use of Information Technology (IT) in modern life, "green" or sustainable solutions capable of minimizing IT impact on the environment become very important. Research on green IT has already produced a variety of approaches aiming at reducing energy usage for data centers and technical equipment, such as computers, projectors, etc. Also methods have been proposed to improve energy efficiency of compilers and software. While focusing on code transformation, the software optimization methods frequently ignore operational features of target hardware and therefore have a limited effect in practice. In this talk we urge for software "greening" techniques that increase efficiency of energy reduction schemes of target hardware. The talk starts with a brief review of factors of energy consumption and main hardware schemes used in the state-of-the-art portable battery-operated devices. Then it discusses software optimizations for lowering energy consumption of CPU, memory, HDD, display, and communication. We argue that algorithm and software optimizations capable of improving computational and data efficiency, exploit adaptive, context-aware and quality-aware processing can all contribute to "green" applications. Open problems of "green" software development are also outlined.},

This calls for suitable models and infrastructures promoting spontaneous, situated, and self-adaptive interactions between components. SAPERE (Self-Aware Pervasive Service Ecosystems) is a general coordination framework aimed at facilitating the decentralized and situated execution of self-organizing and self-adaptive pervasive computing services. SAPERE adopts a nature-inspired approach, in which pervasive services are modeled and deployed as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services and devices, all of which interact in accord to a limited set of coordination laws, or eco-laws. In this article, we present the overall rationale underlying SAPERE and its reference architecture. We introduce the eco-laws--based coordination model and show how it can be used to express and easily enforce general-purpose self-organizing coordination patterns. The middleware infrastructure supporting the SAPERE model is presented and evaluated, and the overall advantages of SAPERE are discussed in the context of exemplary use cases.},

However, what does this mean for engineering skills needed to initiate and grow an ecosystem with software systems being developed, evolved and operated? In this position paper, we introduce new roles and skill profiles required for engineering software ecosystems. We derived the initial role description based on practical experiences in projects we conducted over the past five years and found these roles to be crucial for the overall success of the organization within a digital ecosystem. Key capabilities we found are strength in business and technology at the same time, the ability to think end-to-end in the ecosystem, and interdisciplinarity regarding software engineering disciplines.},

While research results exist in measuring and controlling the level of greenness of hardware components, research is needed to relate energy consumption to executing software and entire cyber physical ecosystems. In the age of context, we can sense and monitor continuously context changes, perform analytics in the cloud, and then actuate physical components according to the computed findings---all from the palm of our hand. While researchers continue to innovate in the realm of CPS, we need to make the feedback loops more sustainable by minimizing energy consumption in its supported processes and decreasing its environmental impact---sensors, monitors, analyzers, planners, actuators, networks, controllers, applications and services. With monitoring in place, we have the opportunity for adaptive control to facilitate greening dynamically. We need to investigate engineering methods to aid engineers with CPS sustainability capabilities. Demonstrating green improvement while still controlling physical components is a key challenge.

The experimental measurements are performed by energy experts and researchers that share the energy model and metrics in a collaborative repository.

	abstract = {Consumer demand for longer lasting battery life in mobile computers, as well as industry interest in energy efficient cloud infrastructure, creates a need for hardware and software energy efficiency improvements. One way to tackle this problem is from a software perspective. If it were known which software changes influenced energy consumption, then tools could be created to help software professionals create more energy efficient software. The process of extracting energy consumption information, Green Mining, is time demanding because researchers must run many tests, with sufficient coverage, on each revision in a software product multiple times. The time required for testing acts as a barrier to extracting energy consumption measurements from new software systems. Therefore, this work proposes, implements, and evaluates a search-based approximation method that trades some precision for a speed-up in the mining process. This speed-up enables researchers to study additional software systems that were too costly to investigate before.},

In particular, in the field of industrial applications, where embedded devices cooperate with many IT systems to make the industrial processes more efficient, to reduce waste or raw materials, and to save the environment, the concept of green software becomes unclear. In this paper, we address the green aspects of software in different phases -- software construction, software execution, and software control in both inside an individual component and as a part of a complete industrial application. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insight into system knowledge, not aspects related to software per se, is the key to create truly green software. Consequently, when considering truly software green, the focus is to be placed on the system level savings for embedded systems at the highest possible level where domain knowledge can be taken into account, not on software development or execution.},

While a sig- nificant body of research exists to measure, monitor, and control the greenness level of hardware components, signif- icant research efforts are needed to relate hardware energy consumption to energy consumption due to program exe- cution. In this paper we report on our investigations to characterize power consumption profiles for different types of compute and memory intensive software applications. In particular, we focus on studying the effects of CPU loads on the power consumption of compute servers by monitoring rack power consumption in a data center. We conducted a series of experiments with a variety of processes of differ- ent complexity to understand and characterize the effect on power consumption. Combining processes of varying com- plexity with varying resource allocations produces different energy consumption levels. The challenge is to optimize pro- cess orchestration based on a power consumption framework to accrue energy savings. Our ultimate goal is to develop smart adaptive green computing techniques, such as adap- tive job scheduling and resource provisioning, to reduce over- all power consumption in data centers or clouds.},

This is shadowed when compared to the research already produced in the computer hardware community. While research in green software is rapidly increasing, several recent studies with software engineers show that they still miss techniques, knowledge, and tools to develop greener software. Indeed, all such studies suggest that green software should be part of a modern Computer Science Curriculum.In this paper, we present survey results from both researchers' and educators' perspective on green software education. These surveys confirm the lack of courses and educational material for teaching green software in current higher education. Additionally, we highlight three key pedagogical challenges in bringing green software to computer science curriculum and discussed existing solutions to address these key challenges. We firmly believe that 'green thinking" and the broad adoption of green software in computer science curriculum can greatly benefit our environment, society, and students in an era where software is everywhere and evolves in an unprecedented speed.},

This model is called Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), which seeks to create the foundations to achieve sustainable development. In Higher Education, there are some examples of the transition process from EE to ESD, especially in Europe, but in some places from Latin America, until now the ESD model is being explored in universities and its acceptance is reviewed. This is further enhanced in engineering programs where ESD is still not very visible. This research presents an analysis of the transition from EE to ESD in an Environmental Engineering program at Santo Tomas University in Colombia, Latin America. A survey was conducted to three groups of students, two groups formed under the EE model, and another group for which an ESD course was created. From the survey and a curricular analysis, it was possible to identify the inclusion status and the student's acceptance of this undergraduate program for the ESD model. As a global result, it is identified that the curriculum is still anchored to EE, but students find the ESD model more attractive and up-to-dated.},

One problem with green mining is that power performance data is not readily available, unlike many other forms of MSR research. Green miners have to create tests and run them across numerous versions of a software project because power performance data was either missing or never existed for that particular project. In this paper we describe multiple open green mining datasets used in prior green mining work. The dataset includes numerous power traces and parallel system call and CPU/IO/Memory traces of multiple versions of multiple products.

	abstract = {With the aim of controlling power consumption in metro/transport and core networks, we consider energy-aware devices able to reduce their energy requirements by adapting their performance. In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art packet processing engines, which generally represent the most energy-consuming components of network devices, and which are often composed of a number of parallel pipelines to ``divide and conquer'' the incoming traffic load. Our goal is to control both the power configuration of pipelines and the way to distribute traffic flows among them. We propose an analytical model to accurately represent the impact of green network technologies (i.e., low power idle and adaptive rate) on network- and energy-aware performance indexes. The model has been validated with experimental results, performed by using energy-aware software routers loaded by real-world traffic traces. The achieved results demonstrate how the proposed model can effectively represent energy- and network-aware performance indexes. On this basis, we propose a constrained optimization policy, which seeks the best tradeoff between power consumption and packet latency times. The procedure aims at dynamically adapting the energy-aware device configuration to minimize energy consumption while coping with incoming traffic volumes and meeting network performance constraints. In order to deeply understand the impact of such policy, a number of tests have been performed by using experimental data from software router architectures and real-world traffic traces.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions resulting from fossil fuels (brown energy) combustion are the main cause of global warming due to the greenhouse effect. Large IT companies have recently increased their efforts in reducing the carbon dioxide footprint originated from their data center electricity consumption. On one hand, better infrastructure and modern hardware allow for a more efficient usage of electric resources. On the other hand, data-centers can be powered by renewable sources (green energy) that are both environmental friendly and economically convenient. In this paper, we tackle the problem of targeting the usage of green energy to minimize the expenditure of running multi-center Web search engines, i.e., systems composed by multiple, geographically remote, computing facilities.We propose a mathematical model to minimize the operational costs of multi-center Web search engines by exploiting renewable energies whenever available at different locations. Using this model, we design an algorithm which decides what fraction of the incoming query load arriving into one processing facility must be forwarded to be processed at different sites to use green energy sources.We experiment using real traffic from a large search engine and we compare our model against state of the art baselines for query forwarding. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution maintains an high query throughput, while reducing by up to ~25% the energy operational costs of multi-center search engines. Additionally, our algorithm can reduce the brown energy consumption by almost 6% when energy-proportional servers are employed.},

Hardware and software manufacturers are beginning to include power saving options in a range of products from processors to operating systems (OS). Previous work on power saving has focused mainly on OS control of the operating modes of laptop computers and mobile devices to maximize battery life. To take full advantage of these newly available energy saving features, we have developed a power management agent with a set of power control and monitoring interfaces which allows power saving features to be implemented on individual applications. We call these power saving capable applications Green Applications.In this demonstration, we will discuss and show a web based Green Application which implements these newly introduced power saving features. This application runs on an IBM HS20 Blade Server with Linux OS and equipped with a processor (Intel Xeon 3 GHz) capable of power management. When the application runs, it continuously adjusts the power level (range from standby to maximum) of the server processor in accordance with the state and performance requirements of the application (expressed as policies or static user-defined control parameters) via the power management agent. The power management agent can manage multiple Green Applications and can set the power level of the processor according to the aggregate power requirement of the applications. Using an advanced monitoring tool, the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) System [1], we will show graphically the dynamic interactions of the state and performance of the application, including processor temperature, CPU utilization, power cap, and power usage in a single integrated view, and present the amount of energy used in comparison with running the same application with no power saving features included.},

We addressed this goal by performing an exploratory case study of five software companies in an emergent software ecosystem. Based on established theories on power, we describe and analyse companies' interactions in this specific context. We believe that by exploring this subject we can support partner firms to understand power configuration in the network and balance opposing forces while evolving their integrated products.},

	abstract = {Software ecosystems (SECOs) involve a number of actors that work together for a shared market. The software products within the software ecosystem typically have a common technological platform, and consist of a keystone player at the center of the ecosystem with niche players addressing market segments the keystone player would otherwise not have access to.Stakeholder identification is critical to the financial and functional success of software development projects, however the task of identifying all stakeholders in a SECO is often not possible due to the high volume of stakeholders and open interfaces. The identification of key stakeholders should ensure that the most relevant requirements are elicited during a software planning cycle.The objective of this research is to examine how key stakeholders can be identified in complex SECOs. This research takes a design science approach and the main component of the current research is the design of an artifact in the form of a reference process model, that is applied in a real-world environment to develop a business process model. Consequently, this research aims to facilitate academia and industry in SECO optimization, especially from a requirements management perspective.},

	abstract = {Power consumption is becoming more and more important with the increased popularity of smart-phones, tablets and laptops. The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer who asks, "will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?" One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of static OO software metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azureus/Vuze BitTorrent client. We found evidence of a potential relationship between some software metrics and power consumption. In conclusion, we explored the effect of software change on power consumption on two projects; and we provide an initial investigation on the impact of software metrics on power consumption.},

The relationship between software quality and software sustainability is still an open question. In this study, a literature survey and comparison was conducted using three-phases, having as a starting point the comparison of basic models for software quality. A follow-up study, conducted at a more comprehensive level to cover both basic models and the most cited tailored models., Software sustainability literature is investigated to find the most frequent characteristics. Finally, data gathered from these studies and a comparison shows a similarity in the top level of these characteristics between software sustainability and software quality, and the emphasis on sustainability, maintainability and portability. The study suggests that ISO 25010 can be utilised by software sustainability. As a future work, the findings will be investigated empirically to support designing software sustainability framework identifying the most important criteria in the technical dimension.},

	abstract = {The optimization of software to be (more) energy efficient is becoming a major concern for the software industry. Although several techniques have been presented to measure energy consumption for software, none has addressed software product lines (SPLs). Thus, to measure energy consumption of a SPL, the products must be generated and measured individually, which is too costly.In this paper, we present a technique and a prototype tool to statically estimate the worst case energy consumption for SPL. The goal is to provide developers with techniques and tools to reason about the energy consumption of all products in a SPL, without having to produce, run and measure the energy in all of them.Our technique combines static program analysis techniques and worst case execution time prediction with energy consumption analysis. This technique analyzes all products in a feature-sensitive manner, that is, a feature used in several products is analyzed only once, while the energy consumption is estimated once per product.We implemented our technique in a tool called Serapis. We did a preliminary evaluation using a product line for image processing implemented in C. Our experiments considered 7 products from such line and our initial results show that the tool was able to estimate the worst-case energy consumption with a mean error percentage of 9.4% and standard deviation of 6.2% when compared with the energy measured when running the products.},

Scenario-based software architecture evaluation methods can support sustainability analysis, but they are still reluctantly used in practice. They are also not integrated with architecture-level metrics when evaluating implemented systems, which limits their capabilities. Existing literature reviews for architecture evaluation focus on scenario-based methods, but do not provide a critical reflection of the applicability of such methods for sustainability evaluation. Our goal is to measure the sustainability of a software architecture both during early design using scenarios and during evolution using scenarios and metrics, which is highly relevant in practice. We thus provide a systematic literature review assessing scenario-based methods for sustainability support and categorize more than 40 architecture-level metrics according to several design principles. Our review identifies a need for further empirical research, for the integration of existing methods, and for the more efficient use of formal architectural models.},

	abstract = {Many organizations follow the same error-prone, time-consuming, and redundant procedures to install software manually, whether as part of a master image or on individual computers. Usually this involves visiting a system, executing some sort of interface, selecting a subset of modules or configuring certain options, and waiting for the installer to complete. There is another way: automated software deployment, which affords greater efficiency, consistency, and ultimately, service. This paper discusses the organization and detailed implementation of automating software installations and updates using silent and unattended methods, with various levels of administrative intervention, from help desk to systems administrator. We also describe different approaches to creating such an environment for both "mass" devices (e.g., public computer lab systems) and individual devices (e.g., faculty/staff desktop systems).Key concepts include leveraging management software and resources you may already have (i.e., the "zero budget" approach) versus efficiency gains from third-party resources, high-level administrative toolkits along with low-level control methods, and developing a workflow for automated and semi-automated software installations.},

	abstract = {Sustainability has emerged as a broad concern for society. Many engineering disciplines have been grappling with challenges in how we sustain technical, social and ecological systems. In the software engineering community, for example, maintainability has been a concern for a long time. But too often, these issues are treated in isolation from one another. Misperceptions among practitioners and research communities persist, rooted in a lack of coherent understanding of sustainability, and how it relates to software systems research and practice. This article presents a cross-disciplinary initiative to create a common ground and a point of reference for the global community of research and practice in software and sustainability, to be used for effectively communicating key issues, goals, values and principles of sustainability design for software-intensive systems. The centrepiece of this effort is the Karlskrona Manifesto for Sustainability Design, a vehicle for a much needed conversation about sustainability within and beyond the software community, and an articulation of the fundamental principles underpinning design choices that affect sustainability. We describe the motivation for developing this manifesto, including some considerations of the genre of the manifesto as well as the dynamics of its creation. We illustrate the collaborative reflective writing process and present the current edition of the manifesto itself. We assess immediate implications and applications of the articulated principles, compare these to current practice, and suggest future steps.},

	abstract = {Software sustainability is a systematic challenge that impacts broad segments of software systems. Software codebases must evolve overtime to address changing contexts and adapt to the flux in middlewares and platforms. In the process, it accumulates arbitrary complexities and its maintenance becomes progressively difficult.Current sustainability approaches focus on the symptoms and tend to be reactive in nature, and ignore the fundamental incentive structures that drive decision-making processes. Moreover, contemporary approaches are insensitive to the uniqueness of each software project context and operate on the assumption that sustainability measurements are universally applicable to the majority of software systems.This paper introduces a fundamentally novel peer-driven approach to managing software sustainability. The methodology ensures that software teams can define their own sustainability measures that adequately address the unique context of their project and its priorities. These measures are dynamically defined by the project peers to ensure their applicability as the project context evolves. Finally, the paper introduces Susereum, a blockchain platform that materializes the methodology and establishes novel incentive structures to systematically promote software sustainability throughout the project lifecycle.},

In this paper, the relationships between architecture and platform adoption are explored by analyzing the results of interviews and document study of five case studies of platform extenders. It is found that platform architecture plays a minor role in platform adoption by platform extenders, but that quality attributes strongly influence an architect's design choices when extending a platform.

	abstract = {Work practices vary among software developers. Some are highly focused on a few artifacts; others make wide-ranging contributions. Similarly, some artifacts are mostly authored, or owned, by one or few developers; others have very wide ownership. Focus and ownership are related but different phenomena, both with strong effect on software quality. Prior studies have mostly targeted ownership; the measures of ownership used have generally been based on either simple counts, information-theoretic views of ownership, or social-network views of contribution patterns. We argue for a more general conceptual view that unifies developer focus and artifact ownership. We analogize the developer-artifact contribution network to a predator-prey food web, and draw upon ideas from ecology to produce a novel, and conceptually unified view of measuring focus and ownership. These measures relate to both cross-entropy and Kullback-Liebler divergence, and simultaneously provide two normalized measures of focus from both the developer and artifact perspectives. We argue that these measures are theoretically well-founded, and yield novel predictive, conceptual, and actionable value in software projects. We find that more focused developers introduce fewer defects than defocused developers. In contrast, files that receive narrowly focused activity are more likely to contain defects than other files.},

	abstract = {Sustainability is the ability of a project / codebase / organization to react to necessary changes over its expected lifespan. At a large enough scale, or with enough disconnect between dependencies, sustainability comes from application of both technical and non-technical approaches. On the technical side, I advocate for restraint among API providers on making arbitrary changes, and use of non-atomic refactoring techniques when more invasive changes are required; such techniques are employed in many Google projects, and in programming languages like Go and C++, to allow more flexible changes to language standards over time. On the non-technical side, I argue for a clear separation of responsibilities (providers need to do the bulk of the work for the update), as well as a growing need to document acceptable usage of an API, be it a library or programming language. In many languages, there are very few changes to an API that are provably safe without this idea: just because a user's code currently works does not mean that it is supported and can be expected to continue to work indefinitely under maintenance. Taken together, these two approaches form what I believe to be a minimum set of requirements when approaching software sustainability.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy-aware and temperature-aware programming model with first-class support for sustainability. A program written in the new language, named Eco, may adaptively adjusts its own behaviors to stay on a given (energy or temperature) budget, avoiding both deficit that would lead to battery drain or CPU overheating, and surplus that could have been used to improve the quality of results. Sustainability management in Eco is captured as a form of supply and demand matching, and the language runtime consistently maintains the equilibrium between supply and demand. Among the efforts of energy-adaptive and temperature-adaptive systems, Eco is distinctive in its role in bridging the programmer and the underlying system, and in particular, bringing both programmer knowledge and application-specific traits into energy optimization. Through a number of intuitive programming abstractions, Eco reduces challenging issues in this domain --- such as workload characterization and decision making in adaptation --- to simple programming tasks, ultimately offering fine-grained, programmable, and declarative sustainability to energy-efficient computing. Eco is an minimal extension to Java, and has been implemented as an open-source compiler. We validate the usefulness of Eco by upgrading real-world Java applications with energy awareness and temperature awareness.},

These definitions mainly point towards technical sustainability over time. Sustainability, however, may entail a much broader scope including economic, social and environmental sustainability as well.In spite of the exciting hype around sustainability, we are very much lacking suitable instruments to design software-intensive systems that are sustainable and enable sustainability goals. To fill this gap, we advocate the treatment of sustainability as a software quality property and define a software sustainability assessment method that helps make sustainability-driven design decisions. The method essentially relies on the definition of so-called decision maps, i.e. views aimed at framing the architecture design concerns around the four sustainability dimensions mentioned above - technical, economic, social and environmental sustainability. This paper presents the notion of decision map. We use two illustrative examples extracted from industrial projects, to summarize our lessons learned and reflections.},

	abstract = {Star cluster ecology is the field of research where stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics, hydrodynamcs and the background potential dynamics of the parent galaxy interact to a complex non-linear evolution of self gravitating stellar systems. I will review the processes related to the ecology of stellar clusters, discuss the numerical hurdles and the physical principles. In addition, I will introduce the AMUSE framework with which we are performing simulations of the ecology of stellar clusters. AMUSE is a general purpose framework for interconnecting existing scientific software with a homogeneous and unified interface. Since the framework is based on the standard message passing interface, any production ready code that is written in a language that supports its native bindings can be incorporated; in addition, our framework is intrinsically parallel and it conveniently separates all the numerical solvers in memory. The strict separation also enables the possibility to realize unit conversion between the different modules and to recover from fatalities in a unified and structured way. The time spent in the framework is relatively small, and for production simulations we measured an overhead of at most 10%, which in our case is acceptable. Due to the unified structure of the interface, incorporating new modules which address the same physics is relatively straightforward. The time stepping between the codes can be simply consecutive or realized via a mixed variable symplectic method in which the Hamiltonian of the problem is solved in separate steps and combined via a Verlet-leapfrog integration scheme. In our experience with an implementation for multiphysics simulations in astrophysics, we encounter relatively few problems with the strict separation in methods, and the results of our test simulations are consistent with earlier results that use a monolithic framework.},

The research in software ecosystems is a relatively young research area, but there are already several works that analyse the literature associated. To conduct a new systematic literature review is necessary to ensure that there are no studies that do the same, namely, that do not answer the same research questions. The identification of the need for a review was done through a study focused on systematic literature reviews and mapping studies about software ecosystems. This work aims to describe the mapping conducted as part of that study. It provides a global state of the art of this kind of studies in the area of software ecosystems.},

	abstract = {When mechanisms move, because the position of the center of mass (CoM) is changing and also the angular momentum is changing, there is vibration within the system, this can degrade the accuracy performance when the system is used in space. Dynamic balance can be applied to address the above problem. Normally, dynamic balancing is accomplished through employing counter-masses or counter-rotations approach. The potential issue is that the more weight and inertia are included inside the system, which is not cost-effective. Here the authors suggest that one can accomplish dynamic balancing condition based on employing the naturally dynamically balanced mechanisms rather than resorting to the old counterweights approaches. For instance, one can accomplish the reactionless condition based on the reconfiguration concept. One does not employ counter-mass but via reconfiguring the system by shifting the linkage, which does not make the system get to be heavy and therefore, reduce the energy costs and achieve green manufacturing. On the basis of this concept, firstly dynamically balance a single limb based on the reconfiguration technique (decomposition) and then integrate the balanced limbs to construct the entire parallel manipulator (integration); i.e. the decomposition and integration concept. Finally, with the mechanical reconfiguration, the control laws governing the operation of the mechanism also need to be changed.},

	abstract = {Architecture design has been for long time relying on graphic drawings and handmade calculations. The results of this procedure was surely an arts and craft product, which very often could not be reproduced or even built in an easy way. Lately, according to the new Computer Aided Systems, many problems - arisen from the impossibility of taking under control various factors - have been solved and a new world of representation, design and construction were born. In the CITTAM (a research centre of the University of Naples) a new methodology has been studied and developed by a team of experts in various disciplines. The methodology, applied to any scale of product, from a small component of a window, until a large urban area, takes into account indicators, parameters and performances of a great number of issues, aimed at assessing the level of sustainability of the product, employed in the construction. This Model, by shape of Multicriteria Matrix, is being processed firstly by means of a structure of Excel sheets, and is now been implementing into a Computer Software, which could help the designers ex-ante, ongoing and after the design procedure and the building construction, in order to allow them to take decisions regarding the choice of materials, shapes, volumes, location, orientation, etc. of the final product. The paper describes the Model and the potential of the innovative Software for assessing sustainability of products, by showing both the structure of the Matrix and the Information Technology. The results, provided by an example of use for a design procedure, demonstrate the usefulness of the tool. In conclusion this new methodology of design and production, by means of Multicriteria Information Tools can help to give again some arts and craft quality to building and architecture, at the same time allowing guarantee of sustainability.},

A golden opportunity, since the companies can analyze data to get a better understanding of e.g. the performance of their organizations and products and take fact based decisions. On the other hand, the large amount of data creates several challenges, e.g. how should the data be collected and stored, what makes measurement systems reliable [3], how the infrastructure should be set-up to support automation. Another challenge is how to identify those few important measures that provide the insight that is necessary for the organization to know that e.g. the product is being developed as specified; to know that there are no problems with the performance of the product when used by customers? In other words, given this plethora of data (e.g. more than 4 000 measurement systems), what should be measured?},

	abstract = {For real-time systems, most of the analysis involves efficient or exact schedulability checking. While this is important, analysis is often based on the assumption that the task parameters such as execution requirements and inter-arrival times between jobs are known exactly. In most cases, however, only a worst-case estimate of these quantities is available at the time of analysis. It is therefore imperative that schedulability analysis hold for better parameter values (Sustainable Analysis). On the other hand, if the task or system parameters turn out to be worse off, then the analysis should tolerate some deterioration (Robust Analysis). Robust analysis is especially important, because the implication of task schedulability is often weakened in the presence of optimizations that are performed on its code, or dynamic system parameters.In this work, we define and address sustainability and robustness questions for analysis of embedded real-time software that is modeled by conditional real-time tasks. Specifically, we show that, while the analysis is sustainable for changes in the task such as lower job execution times and increased relative deadlines, it is not the case for code changes such as job splitting and reordering. We discuss the impact of these results in the context of common compiler optimizations, and then develop robust schedulability techniques for operations where the original analysis is not sustainable.},

	abstract = {From 1991 to 2015, 60 papers published in the ASE and SCAM conferences introduced static analysis prototypes or tools as academic software developed to support research. In this study, we characterize such academic software concerning sustainability. We performed an exploratory study regarding publicization (whether the software is available from an explicitly given URL in a software publication), evolution stage (initial development, evolution, servicing, phase-out or close-down), and recognition (the way others mention the software in their papers). Thereby, we discussed the results under the umbrella of software sustainability. Results for the academic software for static analysis published at ASE and SCAM, show that 40% are not publicly available from the URL informed by the authors; 78% are in an initial development stage, discontinued, or closed-down; 23% has no mentions in relevant digital libraries besides the original software publication, but 30% received contributions to their source code. We observed that a large number of academic static analysis software has inadequate publicization, short life cycles and low recognition. A systematic analysis of publicization, software life cycle, and recognition of academic software is viable, and its results may be useful to support rapid decision-making on adopting academic software for use or even as a target for contribution. The results may also promote a more inclusive view of scientific reputation with respect to the academic software produced by researchers.},

Social dimension encompasses the direct support of the software systems in any domain, as well as activities or processes that create benefits for social communities, such as health, education, and transportation. Although social aspects have been previously examined within the broader context of software engineering, the software systems design based on the notion of social sustainability is still poorly understood and practiced. This paper outline relevant points surrounding social sustainability as a concern in software architectures design. In particular, we discuss some issues in designing software systems that generate social values and have a positive impact on communities. We hope that this discussion will help broaden the concept of social sustainability in architectural design decisions and to bring awareness to the particular needs of software systems that have a direct impact on human well-being and contribute to sustainable development.},

As the annual growth in traffic is doubling every two years with more and more connections to the Internet, to be energy and carbon-aware it is paramount to implement a Monitoring and Measurement System which supports green strategies in a geographically distributed environment. Such an environment has some specific challenges that must be taken into account, such as the WAN connection, security and latency concerns. On the other hand, it also provides opportunities to reduce operational costs and emissions, improve reliability and resources management etc. This work proposes a framework which is capable of supporting green metrics in network monitoring. The framework comprises temporally differentiated data on emission factors and provides ground information able to support different applications. We have implemented the framework in a nationwide testbed and our experiments show the framework is able to provide the ground information for customizable green metrics, like power/energy, traffic, and carbon equivalent emissions. This framework can be used as a support for a variety of applications which depend on energy and emissions metrics.},

	abstract = {Sustainability is the use of existing resources without compromising them for future generations. Resources must be guaranteed in the environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Sustainable Software Engineering is an emerging research field aiming to minimize software development's negative impacts on society. Furthermore, software sustainability can be defined as a way of keeping something running at a certain level of quality in relation to these dimensions. From the social dimension perspective, it is necessary to confirm software's trade-offs, benefits, and impacts on society since it lacks empirical evidence of its achievements in software. In this research thesis, we will explore how the literature addresses the aspect of social sustainability during software development and understand how social sustainability approaches can be integrated into the context of agile software development. In the end, we expect to have a set of guidelines, activities, and practices that can be adopted by agile teams.},

	abstract = {The underlying principles of Sustainable Software Engineering are a core set of competencies Software Engineers need for defining, building, and running sustainable software applications. However, despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be challenging to understand the value of the principles behind sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice. Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might trigger further discussions around the SSD's underlying principles and concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.},

	abstract = {Supporting sustainability with software is often summed up in the expression Green IT and directly relates to the reduction of CO2 emissions and energy used by IT. The amount of CO2 used in the IT industry covers 2% of the overall CO2 emissions. Green by IT describes the influence of appropriate software to the remaining 98% of the industry. We estimate that the effect of our sustainability related software on our customers CO2 footprint could be 10.000 times higher than our own. The so called triple bottom line defines sustainability as covering economic, ecological, and social aspects and the dependencies between. Based on this definition of sustainability, software could not only focus on green house gas reduction. Other topics like: consumers protection, sustainable supply, reduction of emission (air, water, waste), recycling, human recourse management and intelligent energy usage must be as well focus areas supported by software. At last software industry should not only focus on delivering tools for life cycle assessment (LCA), we should use it and provide a LCA for our software self. The industrial question is how to increase short and long term profitability by holistically managing economic, social and environmental risks and opportunities supported by software.},

	abstract = {The software ecosystem is providing a new way of interpreting the software industry. Primarily, software ecosystem modeling, one of the most studied areas in the software ecosystem domain, is an emerging field. However, modeling software ecosystems present several challenges: (a) How can value chains be identified in an ecosystem? (b) What are the typical roles that an actor plays in an ecosystem? (c) How can a boundary in an ecosystem be described?To capture the ecosystem of the Dutch software industry, we performed forty-two case studies. This work enhanced the software supply network diagram to define the proposed diagrams of an ecosystem within this industry. We determined eight value chain models that can be used to identify typical roles that an actor plays in an ecosystem.We observed that most, if not all software producing organizations are hybrid companies in that they fill multiple roles in the value chains. The resulting models enable ones to identify actors and their roles quickly in an ecosystem. Moreover, they facilitate further understanding of the elemental business models and value chains. As such, this work provides an elementary step towards a software ecosystem modeling language.},

	abstract = {In the past 70 years, science research methods have expanded from test tubes and beakers to include simulations in software. Scientific software is produced in a larger environment of collaboration that includes not only software developers, but also scientists who both use and extend the software for their research endeavors. The objective of this research is to understand the factors that promote and inhibit ecosystem formation and sustainment specific to scientific research software development. We have identified a set of relevant problems inhibiting sustainability in the scientific software context, including development, evolution and maintenance, as well as funding and leadership. We have collected data and used existing business, software, and innovation analysis techniques to examine the artifacts from several scientific research projects. We interviewed significant actors in select scientific ecosystems. We describe the differences between scientific software ecosystems and commercial software ecosystems, our initial results from interviews and data analysis, and we provide a set of recommendations and approaches towards handling software sustainability. Data suggests an ecosystem strategy can contribute to the survivability and sustainability of research software; however, such a strategy, which may distract from sustainability, requires thought and effort be given to establishing and nurturing the ecosystem, which in turn distract from the research mission. At this stage these initial results point us to future potentially fruitful investigations.},

Using learning-oriented assessment procedures, supervisors can assess the teamwork abilities with a formative purpose. Evaluation strategies such as self-assessment, peer assessment and co-assessment are often used to make evaluation formative and sustainable. Conducting an assessment strategy is not easy for team members, since they need before to have a reasonable understanding of the evaluation process and criteria. This paper describes a learning-oriented evaluation methodology and a open data framework that can be applied to collaborative software development project settings. An evaluation rubric and a series of indicators that provide evidences about the developed skills have been elaborated and applied in a small-scale project-based course on Web Engineering. Projects were managed and developed with the help of an open source software forge that contains a ticketing tool for planning and tracking of tasks, a version control repository to save the software deliverables, and using a wiki to host text deliverables. The experience provides evidences in favor of using the assessment method and open data framework to make teamwork evaluation more sustainable.},

Solar photovoltaics (PV) is a clean and renewable technology that can be potentially used to power large wafer fabs. There exist some critical factors slowing the proliferation of facilities powered by PVs, including high capital costs and power output intermittency. This study investigates the reliability and the costs of operating a PV-based distributed generation (DG) system to generate renewable energy for wafer fabs. In addition to PVs, the DG system also features storage devices and a net metering function. We developed a simulation model to mimic the PV generation and load variability. The goal is to design a reliable and cost-effective PV-based DG system to mitigate carbon emissions. Two case studies are presented in this paper to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DG system for fabs located in Austin Texas, USA, and Dresden, Germany.},

However, the major challenge of managing an infrastructure ecosystem like OpenStack or Debian is to provide a polished, well-integrated product to the end user, since each individual project has its own release cycle and roadmap. To understand how modern ecosystems deal with this challenge, I empirically study the release synchronization strategy of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which a central release management team manages the six-month release cycle of the overall OpenStack product. By studying one year of release team IRC meeting logs, 9 major federated release management activities were identified, which were cataloged and documented. My findings suggest that even though an ecosystem's power lies in the interaction of autonomous projects, release synchronization is a non-trivial goal. Currently, I am performing interviews with key software developers within the OpenStack ecosystem, in order to understand the major release activities.},

Our goal is to bring together academics and practitioners to discuss research initiatives, challenges, ideas, and results in this critically important area of the software industry. This second edition of the workshop was held at ICSE 2013 in San Francisco, CA, USA. The theme of GREENS 2013 is Leveraging "Energy Efficiency to Software Users." It featured a keynote talk, ten research papers and three breakout sessions that discussed topics that ranged from qualities vs. energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, to green models and views for (software) products/process and to stakeholders, relevant metrics and measurements. In this report, we present the themes of the workshop, and summarize the results of the discussions held in the breakout sessions, as well as the identified research challenges for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Green's function for the Laplace operator represents the propagation of influence of point sources and is the foundation for solving many physics problems. On a graph of pairwise similarities, the Green's function is the inverse of the combinatorial Laplacian; we resolve the zero-mode difficulty by showing its physical origin as the consequence of the Von Neumann boundary condition. We propose to use Green's function to propagate label information for both semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. We also derive this learning framework from the kernel regularization using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space theory at strong regularization limit. Green's function provides a well-defined distance metric on a generic weighted graph, either as the effective distance on the network of electric resistors, or the average commute time in random walks. We show that for unsupervised learning this approach is identical to Ratio Cut and Normalized Cut spectral clustering algorithms. Experiments on newsgroups and six UCI datasets illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, we propose a novel item-based recommender system using Green's function and show its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing pervasiveness of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) not only is determining radical changes in everyone's life-style, in the social organizations, and in the economic dynamics, but it is causing relevant direct and indirect effects on the environment as well. One of the aspects not yet sufficiently addressed in literature is the sustainability of the software lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on the sustainability management of software development projects. In the practice, software development projects are managed by considering principally parameters as time, costs and quality of work products. We propose a methodological approach aimed at identifying sustainability indicators to be used in project management to set up sustainability objectives for a software development project, to control their achievement during the project itself and, possibly, to adopt corrective actions to maintain the project aligned with them. The availability of such sustainability indicators may contribute to reduce the carbon footprint of the activities performed in software development projects as well as to speed-up the development of a green culture in organizations developing software.},

It is important to establish a long-term Quality assurance system of green supply chain of agri-products in China which is a large agricultural country. In this paper, the operation quality of green supply chain of agri-products is taken as a research object. On the basis of literature review and market investigation, a long-term quality assurance system of green supply chain of agri-products is constructed. Firstly, the green supply chain of agri-products is composed of five links: green supply, green planting, green logistics, green marketing and green recycling. According to above, the hierarchical structure of the index system is constructed: five primary indicators, fifteen secondary indicators and twelve tertiary indicators. Fuzzy-AHP method is used to evaluate the quality level of green supply chain of agri-products. Secondly, the construction of quality assurance system for supply chain of agri-products can be constantly improved and promote the improvement of greenness of supply chain through the four links: plan, do, check and act. The research achievement can provide consumers with green, pollution-free and organic agri-products, improve the market competitiveness of agri-products supply chain, reduce environmental pollution and save resources, promote the harmonious development of human and nature.},

	abstract = {As environmental sustainability issues have come to the societal and governmental forefront, a new breed of Green Information Systems (IS)---Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) Green IS---is emerging. A ULS Green IS is an open socio-technical ecosystem that differs from traditional IS in scale, complexity and urgency. Design issues found in ULS systems, System of Systems, Edge-dominant, Metropolis systems and Green IS converge and multiply in the ULS Green IS context. This paper presents a design framework and an architecture analysis method, ECO-ARCH, to address the design of such systems. Through an action research study on architecting for Demand Response systems in the Smart Grid, this article illuminates the system characteristics of ULS Green IS and endorses a fundamental shift in design thinking for its design -- from "bounded rationality" for problem solving to "expandable rationality" for design for the unknown and for innovation. ECO-ARCH advances existing software architecture analysis methods by complimenting expandable rationality design thinking with proven engineering techniques in a dual-level macroscopic-microscopic analysis. This tackles the unique architecting problems of ULS Green IS where many stakeholders are unknown and design goals are not provided, where no architecture pre-exists, where system behavior is non-deterministic and continuously evolving, and where co-creation with consumers and prosumers is essential to achieving triple bottom line goals.},

	abstract = {Sustainable Open Source Software (OSS) forms much of the fabric of our digital society, especially successful and sustainable ones. But many OSS projects do not become sustainable, resulting in abandonment and even risks for the world's digital infrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this mainly from two very different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on understanding success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective: the OSS programmers' day-to-day activities and the artifacts they create. In institutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis has been on institutional designs (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure project governance. Even though each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the connection and interaction between the two approaches have been barely explored.In this paper, we make the first effort toward understanding OSS project sustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining institutional analysis with socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic approaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors' communications to represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii) construct socio-technical networks based on longitudinal collaboration records to represent each project's organizational structure. We combined the two methods and applied them to a dataset of developer digital traces from 253 nascent OSS projects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator. We find that the socio-technical and institutional features relate to each other, and provide complimentary views into the progress of the ASF's OSS projects. Refining these combined analyses can help provide a more precise understanding of the synchronization between the evolution of institutional governance and organizational structure.},

A growing of international port standards recognizes the need to standardize sustainable port development. Indonesia's government proposed a green port policy to meet this requirement. However, different views and interests make it difficult for the government to coordinate private stakeholders and the various economic sectors to support the policy implementation. This paper analyzes different perspectives from different actors to find potential conflict as the basis for the government collaborates among actors to accelerate Indonesia's green port implementation. Dynamic Actor Network Analysis (DANA) is used to define each viewpoint in the perspective diagram systematically. Each perspective diagram generates one hypothesis, and we get which actors with the potential to cooperate and which actors are not by confirming all hypotheses. This paper concludes that DANA can develop and promote multi-actor system arrangements that address all port-related stakeholders' interactions.},

	abstract = {Software Ecosystems (SECOs) have emerged as an approach to improve Software Engineering (SE) in industry considering relations among companies and stakeholders. Companies have opened up their platforms and artifacts to others, including partners and third-part developers. Thus, systems architecture, businesses and social networks should be understood in an integrated way. This concern motivated an initial proposal of a framework for SECOs engineering in order to outline a set of steps that combines three different dimensions of SECOs and joins different perspectives in SECOs research literature through a survey. In this paper, the focus is on the second dimension, business. A preliminary analysis carried out on a Software Reuse Lab's SECO at COPPE/UFRJ points out that concepts explored by researchers can be merged in a broader SE approach.},

The popularity of smartphones brought along the mobile software ecosystems, such as iOS and Android, which are composed of a platform, a community of users and developers, mobile applications, and online application store, and evangelists that often promote the ecosystem. Given the recent nature of the topic, this paper aims to revisit the state-of-the-art through a systematic literature mapping. We found 63 publications on the topic of mobile software ecosystems that were categorized by year (almost 50% of the publications are from 2015 and on), by author (a few collaboration clusters were identified), and by the mobile ecosystems characteristics (most publications discuss business or technical aspects) and elements (applications and the platform are the most discussed topics followed by the developers and the users). Our results provide an up-to-date map of the topic for those interested in mobile software ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Today more and more software operates in a software ecosystem where software products and services are shared over a common technological platform between business actors. In such a setting, a software platform API becomes the interface between the platform and its owner(s) on the one side and other actors and their extensions on the other side. In such ecosystem context, platform API fitness for application development has a huge impact on the success of the ecosystem. However, software ecosystems are usually evolving at a high pace given their dynamic structure and the continuously changing business strategies of ecosystem actors. The design of APIs for software ecosystems therefore has to co-evolve. In this position paper, we propose a continuous (re-)assessment method for platform APIs that takes into account ecosystem needs. We illustrate the method with insights from an ongoing case study.},

	abstract = {Despite the proliferation of software ecosystems (SECOs), growing a sustainable and healthy SECO remains a significant challenge. One approach to mitigate this challenge is the utilization of a mechanism that collects feedback from distributors (distros) and end-users of the SECO releases. This presentation aims at investigating the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism implemented by OpenStack to address the needs of end-users and distros. I mined the OpenStack repositories and mapped 20 distros' bug-related activities. Results suggest that OpenStack releases are actively maintained for 18 months before reaching end-of-life (EOL), which makes coordination with distros difficult because distros usually provide services to their end-users for a period between 36 - 60 months before reaching EOL. Also, bugs are fixed faster by the distros (7 - 76 days) than the OpenStack community (average of 4 months). However, only 22% of the bugs addressed by OpenStack distros are pushed back upstream.},

As a matter of fact, cloud users require that the service level they are paying for is tightly met, whereas data center owners try to cut down their operational expenses.In this paper, we propose a novel consolidation algorithm that exploits emerging software development paradigms. Our approach enables cloud users to indicate their willingness to apply energy saving mechanisms to some of their virtual resources, hence giving infrastructure managers the ability to apply more efficient workload consolidation and to switch their hardware to very low-power states. The result is an optimal trade-off between energy consumption and performance.},

However, issues exist, including vagueness and complexity of the concept itself, in addition to immaturity of the Software Engineering (SE) field. Aims: The study surveys respondents on software sustainability dimensions and characteristics from their perspectives, and seeks to derive rankings for their priority. Method: An exploratory study was conducted to quantitatively investigate Saudi Arabian (KSA) software user's perceptions with regard to the concept itself, the dimensions and characteristics of the software sustainability. Survey data was gathered from 906 respondents. Results: The results highlight key dimensions for sustainability and their priorities to users. The results also indicate that the characteristics perceived to be the most significant, were security, usability, reliability, maintainability, extensibility and portability, whereas respondents were relatively less concerned with computer ethics (e.g. privacy and trust), functionality, efficiency and reusability. A key finding was that females considered the environmental dimension to be more important than males. Conclusions: The dimensions and characteristics identified here can be used as a means of providing valuable feedback for the planning and implementation of future development of sustainable software.},

However, even with investments in the DevRel, some organizations face the death of their ecosystems, for example: Symbian (2012), Firefox OS (2016), Windows Phone (2017). It can also be compared based on Ecology to a disruption of the "food chain" that can turn a dynamic ecosystem in a static or dead ecosystem. For example, Microsoft announced in 2017 that Windows Phone would no longer push any updates and became only focusing on maintenance. We want to contribute in understanding how, why and when a SECO is turning on static (i.e., dying) and the "post mortem" status of a SECO. We initially study the Windows Phone from 46,030 questions in Stack Overflow to understand what happens to a SECO when the core platform is discontinued. From our result analysis we perceived that it can be useful to understanding the "vital signals" of ecosystem collapse, migratory/survival patterns, technical resource recycling and the energy transfer among individuals, populations, communities and SECOs.

The potentially transformational benefits of software ecosystems stems, primarily, from two basic principles that software ecosystems have embraced: transparency, a pillar in open source development, and modular system design. Despite the benefits associated with transparency and modularity, there are also important challenges that deserve attention. In this paper, we introduce the concept of interface translucence as an architectural mechanism that seeks to overcome challenges faced by transparency and modular system design. Interface translucence leverages the important technical role that interfaces play in software architectures to bridge the technical and socio-organizational dimensions of software development in ecosystems. We present an application of the concept of interface translucence in the context of architecting a software system as well as in the context of implementing it.

	abstract = {Software ecosystems have adopted many different strategies to achieve success and good health. The role of software architect is one of the main contributors to that success. Their activities are crucial for realizing the business strategy of their organization. Software ecosystems define multi-sided markets that require different strategies from a traditional two-sided market. The architectural practices in the multi-sided market must support the need for flexibility and rapid reaction. These new demands broaden our understanding of the software architect's role and the impact of their action on ecosystem structure. In particular the need to understand how to operate in a collaborative, cooperative environment to exploit competition. In this position paper, we discuss how software architect's actions influence the ecosystem health through their indicators: productivity, niche creation, and robustness.},

In an open-question survey we asked framework and library developers about their information needs with respect to both their upstream and downstream projects. We investigated what kind of information is required, why is it necessary, and how the developers obtain this information. The results show that the downstream needs are grouped into three categories roughly corresponding to the different stages in their relation with an upstream: selection, adoption, and co-evolution. The less numerous upstream needs are grouped into two categories: project statistics and code usage. The current practices part of the study shows that to satisfy many of these needs developers use non-specific tools and ad hoc methods. We believe that this is a largely unexplored area of research.},

Recent incidents, such as the Equifax data breach and the leftpad package removal, demonstrate the difficulty in assessing the severity, impact and spread of bugs in dependency networks. While dependency checkers are being adapted as a counter measure, they only provide indicative information. To remedy this situation, we propose a fine-grained dependency network that goes beyond packages and into call graphs. The result is a versioned ecosystem-level call graph. In this paper, we outline the process to construct the proposed graph and present a preliminary evaluation of a security issue from a core package to an affected client application.},

At the level of software ecosystems, which are collections of software projects, the dependencies that need to be recovered reside not only within the individual systems, but also between the libraries, frameworks, and entire software systems that make up the complete ecosystem; scaling issues arise.In this paper we present and evaluate several variants of a lightweight and scalable approach to recover dependencies between the software projects of an ecosystem.

There are several related elements in the testing activity that can be further investigated through the concepts defined in the software ecosystem (SECO) research. The study of testing and joint SECO addresses challenges and opportunities that go forward application development in a project, through an entire development network from suppliers to stakeholders. [Objective] In this paper, we propose a definition of software testing ecosystem (STECO) and report research opportunities, to bring close these two different research fields fostering the conduction of new research at the intersection of these two topics to investigate the elements of testing activity that constitute an ecosystem and how it can be tested to improve software quality. [Method] The concept of STECO is defined and we perform a literature search. Hence, to illustrate the idea of a STECO, we designed a model to describe the elements involved around the JUnit SECO and describe some research opportunities considering the knowledge of the testing and SECO fields. [Results and Conclusions] The following research opportunities are highlighted to foster new research works: (i) the conduction of functional and nonfunctional requirements testing, as well as the challenges imposed from this activity; (ii) the need for testing products developed separated from the central SECO platform; (iii) conduction of studies on testing automation on SECO platforms; (iv) testing between the different technologies that composed a SECO; and (v) testing the mobile software ecosystem (MSECO) environment, that has been presenting a fast growth in the number of applications.},

This exponential increase in the digital intensity of human existence is driven by many factors, including ease of use and availability of a rich set of information technology (IT) devices and services. Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine how significant societal transformations that better our world could occur without the productivity and innovation enabled by the IT. Unfortunately, the energy cost and carbon footprint of the IT devices and services has become exorbitant. Moreover, current technological and digital service utilization trends result in a doubling of the energy cost of the IT infrastructure and its carbon footprint in less than five years. In an energy-constrained world, this consumption trend is unsustainable and comes at increasingly unacceptable societal and environmental costs. This presentation will first explain what is meant by green computing and how greenness of information processing may be quantified. Next, energy-efficient computing paradigms which utilize chip multi-processing, multiple-voltage domains, dynamic voltage/frequency scaling, and power/clock gating techniques will be reviewed. Finally, techniques for improving performance per Watt of large-scale information processing and storage systems (e.g., a data center), including hierarchical dynamic power management, task placement and scheduling, energy balancing, resource virtualization, and application optimizations that dynamically configure hardware for higher efficiency will be discussed.},

Access to this data is critical to facilitating reproducibility of research results, enabling scientists to build on others' work, and providing data journalists easier access to information and its provenance. In this paper, we discuss Google Dataset Search, a dataset-discovery tool that provides search capabilities over potentially all datasets published on the Web. The approach relies on an open ecosystem, where dataset owners and providers publish semantically enhanced metadata on their own sites. We then aggregate, normalize, and reconcile this metadata, providing a search engine that lets users find datasets in the ``long tail'' of the Web. In this paper, we discuss both social and technical challenges in building this type of tool, and the lessons that we learned from this experience.},

Thus, developing lightweight yet effective SR models has become a frequent demand in industrial applications, which is also in line with the ideals of Green AI and Green IR. In this applied paper, we introduce GreenSeq deployed in Alipay to automatically design Green networks that can provide appropriate recommendations with lower computational consumption in SR. Specifically, GreenSeq uses a novel multi-layer search space that allows for flexible network design and a Greenness-aware loss term for balancing efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on benchmark datasets and A/B testing show that GreenSeq performs well while using fewer resources. GreenSeq also reduces electricity and carbon emissions in Alipay.},

In this paper, we set out to study how physicians have integrated teleconsultation into their healthcare practices. Moreover, we are interested in how teleconsultation software contributes to developing new medical practices and how the design of teleconsultation software can better support them. Based on 16 months of fieldwork in a general hospital that offers two different teleconsultation software, we have investigated teleconsultation practices through interviews and observations involving ten physicians doing teleconsultation and a telemedicine secretary. Unlike the existing informal remote care by phone, we observe that teleconsultation supports new formal healthcare practices, particularly for patient care management and inter-organizational cooperation. While analyzing the integration of teleconsultation in physicians' practices, we highlight that both pieces of software do not support those practices on equal terms according to their design. We argue that teleconsultation software design can limit the spread of these new healthcare practices and that the artifact ecology of physicians should be considered during the design process.},

	abstract = {In finance, leverage is the ratio between assets borrowed from others and one's own assets. A matching situation is present in software: by using free open-source software (FOSS) libraries a developer leverages on other people's code to multiply the offered functionalities with a much smaller own codebase. In finance as in software, leverage magnifies profits when returns from borrowing exceed costs of integration, but it may also magnify losses, in particular in the presence of security vulnerabilities. We aim to understand the level of technical leverage in the FOSS ecosystem and whether it can be a potential source of security vulnerabilities. Also, we introduce two metrics change distance and change direction to capture the amount and the evolution of the dependency on third-party libraries.The application of the proposed metrics on 8494 distinct library versions from the FOSS Maven-based Java libraries shows that small and medium libraries (less than 100KLoC) have disproportionately more leverage on FOSS dependencies in comparison to large libraries. We show that leverage pays off as leveraged libraries only add a 4% delay in the time interval between library releases while providing four times more code than their own. However, libraries with such leverage (i.e., 75% of libraries in our sample) also have 1.6 higher odds of being vulnerable in comparison to the libraries with lower leverage.We provide an online demo for computing the proposed metrics for real-world software libraries available under the following URL: https://techleverage.eu/.},

	abstract = {Context: Diversity has been addressed in software ecosystem studies in recent years, aiming at the inclusion and collaboration of different groups within organizations and communities. Its several forms of manifesting have required a better understanding of its effects on the ecosystem. Problem: Since an ecosystem involves the interaction of actors over a common technological platform that supports software solutions or services, the diversity and the relationships between different actors remain a challenge, especially in order to sustain the ecosystem and stimulate its growth. Solution: This study aims to understand how diversity manifests itself in the ecosystem context, based on the existing studies. IS Theory: The research was developed under the aegis of the General Systems Theory, focusing on the relationships between the elements of the system. Method: A systematic mapping study was carried out to identify and characterize how diversity in ecosystems has been discussed, which approaches have been applied and which effects are observed. Results: Based on 13 selected studies, we observed that the most discussed type is demographic diversity and the subtype is gender diversity. It was also noticed that gender diversity increases the productivity of development teams, despite the fact that they are still mostly male. Additionally, an analysis was carried out on how these studies discuss diversity in light of the 15 human, technical and organizational factors of ecosystems. Contribution: The five factors that most affect diversity in ecosystems were identified and actionable approaches were suggested to increase diversity in ecosystems, contributing to the Grand Research Challenge in Information Systems ``Information Systems and the Open World Challenges''.},

	abstract = {Software Engineering (SE) is a discipline that deals with aspects of software production. Often, only the technical aspects are taught in the classes, and the economic and social aspects involved in software development are not reinforced in the classroom. In this context, the concept of a Software Ecosystem (SECO) emerged, defined as a set of actors acting as a unit interacting with a market distributed between software and services, with relationships supported by a technological platform or a common market, carried out by exchanging information, artifacts and resources. SECO teaching is not common in SE classes. However, when adding this knowledge, it is possible to have the benefit of a more global vision of SE, with the relationships between suppliers, technological platforms and customers. Moreover, there is a lack of SECO models and examples in the literature, making its study difficult. This article presents the ARIEL tool, with the aim of mitigating this gap and supporting the teaching of SECO in SE. For this, an user experience evaluation was projected using the DECIDE framework as a reference, with undergraduate and graduate students. As a result of this work, the participants stated it was easy to use the tool and they made few mistakes, most of them felt satisfied when using the tool, and the level of mental effort to carry out the activities is low.},

The successful application of such schemes necessitates a careful analysis so that the amount of degradation of the SLAs with respect to power savings can be quantified helping the data center operators to set up the optimal configuration. In this paper, we study and analyze a system consisting of a data center, its operator, and IT clients under the consideration of relaxed SLAs. For this purpose, we consider a data center system consisting of two heterogeneous pools of servers, where each server is modeled using the single-server system with a power-saving inactive state, non-zero (random) activation/deactivation times, and hot standby state. Making use of the distributional Little's Law, derive the steady-state performance (in terms of response time distribution) and average power demand and study the power-performance trade-off in an explicit way. Numerical results illustrate the model's theoretical properties, under different considerations of low, medium, and high workload utilization rates.},

This way of writing software puts an emphasis on reuse and on composition, commoditizing the services that modern applications require. On the other hand, bugs and vulnerabilities in a single library living in one such ecosystem can affect, directly or by transitivity, a huge number of other libraries and applications. Currently, only product-level information on library dependencies is used to contain this kind of danger, but this knowledge often reveals itself too imprecise to lead to effective (and possibly automated) handling policies. We will discuss how fine-grained function-level dependencies can greatly improve reliability and reduce the impact of vulnerabilities on the whole software ecosystem.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of empirical evidence on software ecosystem health metrics, and a need for operationalizable metrics that describe software ecosystem characteristics. This study unveils a new approach for measuring technical variety concisely. Studies show that a high variety opens up new opportunities and thus, better niche creation, and ultimately, improves software ecosystem health. Four different ecosystems are evaluated, and compared. Variety is measured in relation to robustness, and productivity metrics of the ecosystem to uncover the influence of technical variety on software ecosystems. Technical variety indicates a positive correlation with robustness, however acceptance of this statement is not confirmed with certainty due to a weak relation. Furthermore, significant relations indicate differences between ecosystem types.},

This paper proposes an evaluation method for software ecosystem practices and a research plan for developing such a method.

These practices and metrics are modeled by three views of the ecosystem: community, business and technical.

	abstract = {Software engineers should have the ability to abstract the complexity of a whole system composed of products, demands and suppliers emerging from an interconnected network termed a software ecosystem (SECO). Since software suppliers resort to virtual integration, software-consuming organizations face difficulties performing IT management activities and analyzing what application or technology enter their SECO. In this context, the `silent' effects of nontechnical factors give rise to serious long-term problems, e.g., low productivity, investment loss, financial crisis, or bankruptcy. This paper presents an investigation of SECO effects on software-consuming organizations performing IT management activities in real settings. IT management teams have regular meetings to deliberate on acquisition decisions which they base on experience and IT market recommendations, including spreadsheets and distributed documents. Analysis of the decision space, business objective synergy, and technology/supplier dependency are identified as the most critical health indicators for SECO platform monitoring in IT management activities. This highlights the critical role acquisition preparation plays in the SECO context.},

Examples are the SECOs surrounding Eclipse or Android. Due to independent release cycles of the multiple vendors for platform and extensions, SECOs are evolving frequently. This makes it hard to get a concise impression of the structure of a SECO and its variable artifacts during a given period of time. We contribute a metamodel to capture the variability in an arbitrary SECO and its evolution based on the notion of real time. We further present a procedure to create temporal perspectives on the SECO. Additionally, we provide means to analyze evolution of variability in between explicit releases of the platform, e.g., in accordance with the different release cycles of individual extensions. We demonstrate feasibility of our approach by modeling a part of the Eclipse SECO over a period of three years.},

This view focuses not only on economic optimization but also on material flow analysis with a possible integration of social criteria opening the door to sustainable production in reality in the future.

This scenario has been investigated as Software Ecosystems (SECO). When the ecosystem is centered in a closed platform, it is known as a proprietary SECO. In this case, establishing software asset management policies and guidelines is a critical aspect for maintaining a sustainable SECO. Contributions from actors that are external to the central organization should be allowed without exposing internal knowledge and risking the ecosystem robustness of the ecosystem. In this context, this study investigates asset governance mechanisms in a proprietary SECO by: (1) a survey research with 34 participants to capture insights on some mechanisms, (2) a set of 8 interviews with a group of managers to analyze the most relevant mechanisms; and (3) a correlation analysis from the managers' opinions.},

They arguably come with a set of benefits that severely counterweights the additional effort of design and implementation. But what is the role of reference architectures in an ecosystem setting?In this position paper, we argue for the use of reference architecture as a means of facilitating the operation of software ecosystems, supporting not only the technical aspects but also business and organizational. Thus, we propose that reference architectures can be used as a tool to facilitate software ecosystem orchestration and promote the ecosystem health.

	abstract = {Software Ecosystem (SECO) is often understood as a set of actors interacting among themselves and manipulating artifacts with the support of a common technology platform. SECO can represent an environment in which the component repository is gathering stakeholders, and software products and components. By manipulating software artifacts, a technical network emerges from component repositories that support Software Reuse. Those repositories often lack resources to support actors' relationships. Introducing social resources in SECO aims at stimulating actors' interactions, information exchange and better understanding on how artifacts are manipulated in such social relations. In this paper, we focus on investigating SECO representing component repositories that include socio-technical resources. A survey with experts was planned and executed. The goal was to identify the relevance of each resource for a SECO based on component repositories, initially focused on the Brazilian scenario. This paper also describes the analysis of the data collected in this survey. Some information of other SECO elements extracted from the data is also presented, e.g., the participants' profile and how they behave within a SECO.},

	abstract = {Software projects are increasingly forming social-technical ecosystems within which individual projects rely on the infrastructures or functional components provided by other projects, leading to complex inter-dependencies. Through inter-project dependencies, a bug in an upstream project may have profound impact on a large number of downstream projects, resulting in cross-project bugs. This emerging type of bugs has brought new challenges in bug fixing due to their unclear influence on downstream projects. In this paper, we present an approach to estimating the impact of a cross-project bug within its ecosystem by identifying the affected downstream modules (classes/methods). Note that a downstream project that uses a buggy upstream function may not be affected as the usage does not satisfy the failure inducing preconditions. For a reported bug with the known root cause function and failure inducing preconditions, we first collect the candidate downstream modules that call the upstream function through an ecosystem-wide dependence analysis. Then, the paths to the call sites of the buggy upstream function are encoded as symbolic constraints. Solving the constraints, together with the failure inducing preconditions, identifies the affected downstream modules. Our evaluation of 31 existing upstream bugs on the scientific Python ecosystem containing 121 versions of 22 popular projects (with a total of 16 millions LOC) shows that the approach is highly effective: from the 25490 candidate downstream modules that invoke the buggy upstream functions, it identifies 1132 modules where the upstream bugs can be triggered, pruning 95.6% of the candidates. The technique has no false negatives and an average false positive rate of 7.9%. Only 49 downstream modules (out of the 1132 we found) were reported before to be affected.},

The keynote presentation by Brent Gorda, head of Intel's High Performance Data Division, highlights the technological advances that underpin the development of ever more performant software defined systems. Finally, a panel of distinguished researchers and industry professionals debates and discusses the technology ramifications of software defined system architectures and design approaches.It is the time to rethink system design and management without boundaries towards software-defined ecosystems, the Big System. The basic principles of software-defined mechanisms and policies have witnessed great success in clouds and networks. We are expecting broader, deeper, and greater evolution and confluence towards holistic software-defined ecosystems. BigSystems 2015, in its second year, continues to provide the venue for early and important innovations in this emerging discipline. We offer a rich program from keynote on feeding data into big systems, paper presentation sessions on software-defined platforms, software-defined systems (OS and data centers), to the panel on building flexibly changeable systems at scale.The First International Workshop on Software-Defined Ecosystems (BigSystem 2014) provides an open forum for researchers, practitioners, and system builders to exchange ideas, discuss, and shape roadmaps towards such big systems in the era of big data.},

@article{10.1145/3274284,
	abstract = {Smart and connected communities (SCCs) are emerging as a novel paradigm that allows the community residents to be connected with surrounding environments through smart technologies. However, there remain important challenges to fully exploit the potential of SCCs in improving societal well-being and prosperity. In particular, there is a need for designing green communication systems that are also capable of providing high quality of service (QoS) to distribute and collect information to and from SCCs. However, simultaneously satisfying both of these criteria is difficult due to varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural/sub-urban areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short-range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3G or 4G technologies (LTE, LTE-A, GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. In recent times, Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed as a solution to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing. In this article, we show that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can also achieve notable benefits in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture for designing sustainable SCCs using a small-scale DSA-enabled overlay network that improves end-to-end energy efficiency of the network while guaranteeing QoS. We also propose a dynamic spectrum band selection approach that intelligently matches any message requirement to a suitable band type by exploiting distinct electro-magnetic characteristics of various bands. Since data generated in SCCs are typically valuable only when delivered within a certain hard (or soft) deadline, we formulate a linear optimization problem for determining the most energy-efficient path that ensures a delivery time within the hard deadline. After proving that such a problem is NP-Hard, we propose an exact pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to solve it followed by a polynomial time greedy heuristic. Additionally, we formulate a non-linear optimization problem to find the optimal path when the message delivery time is defined as a soft deadline and extend our greedy heuristic to handle soft deadlines. Compared to the homogeneous band access approaches that opportunistically access free channels within a given spectrum band, our extensive simulation study shows that the proposed dynamic multi-band selection approach significantly improves the achievable energy efficiency while meeting various hard and soft deadlines.},

Consequently, variability management processes are at the heart of current software product line engineering practices. However, legacy software systems exist that have not been developed with such practices. Moreover, an increasing amount of software is developed in large, fragmented communities, also referred to as software ecosystems. Variability in such systems is often not explicitly managed and causes significant difficulties during software maintenance and evolution. Methods and tools for uncovering and explicitly managing this variability have been subject to ongoing research.

	abstract = {Companies nowadays need to serve a mass market while at the same time customers request highly individual solutions. To handle this problem, development is frequently organized in software ecosystems (SECOs), i.e., interrelated software product lines involving internal and external developers. Individual products for customers are derived and adapted by adding new features or creating new versions of existing features to meet the customer-specific requirements. Development teams typically use version control systems to track fine-grained, implementation-level changes to product lines and products. However, it is difficult to relate such low-level changes to features and their evolution in the SECO. State-of-the-art approaches addressing this issue are variation control systems, which allow tracking of changes at the level of features. However, these systems have not found their way into mainstream development so far. In this thesis we will describe which workflows and additions to variation control systems are required to support feature-oriented development in an industrial SECO environment. We will further investigate mechanisms that support feature-based monitoring to guide the evolution in SECOs.},

It provides a perspective on software ecosystems that can be used to create better understanding of them and more effective ecosystem health analysis. Objectives. The objective of this research is to introduce the concept of sub-ecosystems to the field of software ecosystems. An extension on the Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization for measuring the health of a sub-ecosystem is created and evaluated with three small case studies. Method. A literature review of both software and natural ecosystem research is used for the definitions of key concepts. Design Science is used for the extension of the Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization. Finally, for the case studies, data is gathered using several data repositories and analyzed to show how the concept of sub-ecosystems is used. Results The concept of software sub-ecosystems is defined. Next to that an extension to the Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization (OSEHO) framework is introduced for considering sub-ecosystems in health assessments. Conclusion The subject of sub-ecosystems provides a promising new perspective on software ecosystems that improves the understanding of this research field for both researchers and practitioners. Additionally, the extended OSEHO framework can be used to more accurately measure the health of an ecosystem by looking at both larger and smaller ecosystems around it.},

Designing user interactive computer front end it will make the system user friendly. Further computer itself is connected to LAN using TCP/IP protocol making monitoring and controlling feasible from remote locations using similar interactive front ends at dispersed locations. This feature eliminate the limitation of monitoring and operating from the place of its installation.Developed system is capable of maintaining a fixed temperature and humidity at desired level as required by the Green House. System will continuously monitor the sense value of temperature against some user defined limit value. If sense value goes beyond limit value system will automatically start some hardware device to bring the sense values at desired level.This paper explores the possibility of controlling and monitoring of temperature and humidity together in a broad interactive way by connecting the system in a personal computer which itself is connected with LAN/IntranetIn many research and Industrial setup monitoring and controlling of temperature and humidity is very essential. Though Microcontroller based embedded systems are found to be very much effective most of such devices are generally provided with LCD and push button keys for monitoring and controlling. Such devices are having its limitations in Display, userfriedliness and monitoring and operating from the place of its installation. In the stated approach effort has been made for effective use of the system eliminating the above stated difficulties.},

Access to accumulated and documented architectural knowledge facilitates this process. In this paper, we present a set of tools that support creative decision making in the different stages an architecture specification goes through. These tools are structured around a central repository, where acquired knowledge is stored for reuse. The approach is motivated by the challenges arising from the particular needs of the software ecosystem environment, where the software design process is characterized by the participation of multiple and diverse stakeholders and the existence of multiple software applications built on a common platform. Our aim is to provide tool support for making quality-driven design decisions in a flexible and reusable manner, facilitating the system's evolvability, as well as enhancing its understandability to the stakeholders involved.},

To counteract this trend, we propose a method for building research software with scale and sustainability in mind so that it can organically grow a large userbase and enable longer-term research. To illustrate this method, we present the design and implementation of Python Tutor (pythontutor.com), a code visualization tool that is, to our knowledge, one of the most widely-used pieces of research software developed within a university lab. Over the past decade, it has been used by over ten million people in over 180 countries. It has also contributed to 55 publications from 35 research groups in 13 countries. We distilled lessons from working on Python Tutor into three sets of design guidelines: 1) user experience design for scale and sustainability, 2) software architecture design for long-term sustainability, and 3) designing a sustainable software development workflow within academia. These guidelines can enable a student to create long-lasting software that reaches many users and facilitates research from many independent groups.},

	abstract = {In the 2020s, the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change became unmistakable. Floods, storms, the mass extinction of flora and fauna, the threats of further pandemics, as well as Russia's war with Ukraine made it necessary for Europeans to act immediately. While the public was still wrangling about the best way to become more resource-conscious, in 2026 the European Union passed a directive that bound ``smart'', artificial-intelligence-infused technologies to the goal of reducing resource consumption by law -- the Green Smart directive. The present paper traces the impact of Green Smart in three everyday domains: laundry, mobility, and gardening. It shows that Green Smart led to a ``decentering'' of the human with beneficial effects on the planet as well as individual wellbeing. Upon release of the directive, smart systems immediately installed policies of CO2 avoidance and resource-saving, which had been discussed for centuries already, but had never actually been implemented. While this was accompanied by fierce debates about ``freedom'' and the ``enslavement'' of humanity by technology, in everyday life, the policies led to an almost instant reduction in resource consumption. New and adapted everyday practices appeared quickly, and many of them changed people's lives clearly for the better. In general, humanity's attitude toward technology changed profoundly. Instead of expecting technology to be a mere tool, always under the immediate control of people and to be used for whatever people saw fit, technology became understood as a powerful ``other'', with its own needs and goals -- even if those were designed by humans themselves. Instead of using technology, people started to cooperate and negotiate with technology about better ways of living.},

However, code analysis and transformation becomes much more difficult without the aid of source-level information to provide a context for its intended operation.

	abstract = {In many domains organizations need to serve a mass market while at the same time customers request highly individual solutions. Companies thus form software ecosystems (SECOs) comprising various related hardware and software product lines (SPLs). Technology changes, internal enhancements, and customer requests drive the evolution of such SECOs. Multiple projects are conducted in parallel to deliver customized solutions to customers. Developers often adhere to a staged configuration process: first, required software components are selected to derive an initial product, which is then evolved by refining features and adapting source code to meet customer requirements. These customer-specific solutions are often created using a clone-and-own approach and typically contain features potentially reusable in other solutions. However, the awareness of developers about such platform extensions is typically low and feedback from products to SPLs is often lacking. In this research-in-progress paper we thus present a publish-subscribe approach fostering the awareness about feature implementations in SECOs. The approach is based on feature feeds and SECO awareness models.},

The leading game companies adopted SECO dynamics, forcing external actors (e.g., game studios) to adapt to a highly competitive scenario. Objective: Considering the significant growth of the Brazilian digital games industry in the last years, this study aims to present and evaluate a business model proposed for the independent Brazilian game studios immersed in the Game SECO (GSECO) context. Method: We explained the proposed model and reported on 15 online interviews to capture comments and suggestions. Three researchers applied the Grounded Theory (GT) procedures to extract actions to improve the business model. Results: 25 suggestions to improve the proposed business model emerged. Finally, we use the business model concepts and subdomains to both define the suggestions to be adopted and identify opportunities for future work. Conclusion: The first version of the business model for independent studios in GSECO reached a high level of relevance in its first evaluation. Some interviewees highlighted the differential of the model in directing the construction of a digital game business contextualized in the Brazilian scenario and how the tool can directly contribute to the maturity of the industry. As future work, we identified the need to expand the model for all subdomains and new evaluation with actors from different regions.},

	abstract = {The development of a software system is now ever more frequently a part of a larger development effort, including multiple software systems that co-exist in the same environment: a software ecosystem. Though most studies of the evolution of software have focused on a single software system, there is much that we can learn from the analysis of a set of interrelated systems. Topic modeling techniques show promise for mining the data stored in software repositories to understand the evolution of a system. In my research I seek to explore how topic modeling techniques can aid in understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem. The results of this research have the potential to improve how topic modeling techniques are used to predict, plan, and understand the evolution of software, and will inform the design of tools that support software engineering activities such as feature location, expertise identification, and bug detection.},

	abstract = {Software-intensive systems have become increasingly ubiquitous, large, and complex, with dissemination in several application domains and tightly dependent upon different technologies. Such systems are usually centered in a software platform so that increasing attention has been paid to influence and interdependency in relationships among all the involved players, forming software ecosystems (SECO). Despite the initial advances in SECO research, few analytical models, case studies with real data, and integrated tool support exist. A great barrier for the evolution of the field towards aiding decision-making in the real industry is the lack of SECO modeling support. In this paper, we aim to perform an exploratory study on the need for modeling in the SECO field. We preliminarily identified some modeling elements from the SECO literature and explored them in the context of a real SECO in the educational domain.},

	abstract = {The idea of software ecosystems encourages organizations to open software projects for external businesses, governing the cross-organizational development by architectural and other measures. Even within a single organization, this paradigm can be of high value for large-scale decentralized software projects that involve various internal, yet self-contained organizational units. However, this intra-organizational decentralization causes architecture challenges that must be understood to reason about suitable architectural measures. We present an in-depth case study on collaboration and architecture challenges in two of these large-scale software projects at Siemens. We performed a total of 46 hours of semi-structured interviews with 17 leading software architects from all involved organizational units. Our major findings are: (1) three collaboration models on a continuum that ranges from high to low coupling, (2) a classification of architecture challenges, together with (3) a qualitative and quantitative exposure of the identified recurring issues along each collaboration model. Our study results provide valuable insights for both industry and academia: Practitioners that find themselves in one of the collaboration models can use empirical evidence on challenges to make informed decisions about counteractive measures. Researchers can focus their attention on challenges faced by practitioners to make software engineering more effective.},

	abstract = {Although the approaches conceptualizing software ecosystems (SECO) have gained more relevance since 2010, there are not many studies addressing proprietary SECO. In a proprietary SECO, organizations are concerned with keeping their assets protected by intellectual property so that they are not exposed publicly, preventing this information from being used by competitors. Understanding how the governance mechanisms work and how organizations handle incidents on their platforms is a real challenge in this scenario. In this work, we aim at: i) providing an update on SECO governance mechanisms and SECO health metrics; ii) analyzing SECO classifications and evaluating the evolution of proprietary SECO; and iii) exploring the organization's strategies in this context and investigating the SECO incident management process. To do so, a longitudinal literature study was performed on SECO, extending an existing study that covered 2006 to 2015. As such, we analyzed 422 studies from 2016 to 2020 and provided an updated perspective based on seven research questions, as well as a refined perspective on proprietary SECO and a deep understanding on the incident management process in this scenario. Results reveal that governance strategies aim to share knowledge, provide continuous innovation and increase competitive advantage in the market.},

Our research attempts to shed light on the following intriguing question: what makes software ecosystems successful? The approach we follow is to perform a quantitative analysis of the R ecosystem. R is a well-established and popular ecosystem, whose community and marketplace are steadily growing. We assess and quantify the ecosystem throughout its history, and derive metrics on its core software components, the marketplace as well as its community. We use our insights to make observations that are applicable to ecosystems in general, validate existing theories from the literature, and propose a predictive model for the evolution of software packages. Our results show that the success of the ecosystem relies on a strong commitment by a small core of users who support a large and growing community.},

Companies and organizations have directly (or not) opened up their software platforms and assets to others, including partners and 3rd party developers, creating software ecosystems (SECOs). This scenario changes the traditional software industry because it requires mature research in SE dealing with an environment where business models and socio-technical networks can impact systems engineering and management, and reuse approaches. However, one strong inhibitor is the complexity in defining and modeling SECO elements to improve their comprehension and analysis. The main reason is the fact that this topic is emerging and no common sense on its concepts and relations exists yet. Thus, it is difficult to understand its real impacts in the SE industry. In this context, we propose an approach to support the definition, modeling and analysis of SECOs by exploring Software Reuse concepts in techniques in this area and treating nontechnical aspects in SE.},

	abstract = {Resilience in urban drainage infrastructure management has gained traction in the last few years, where systems need to adapt and recover from failure in face of deep uncertain threats. Green infrastructures, on-site nature-based stormwater strategies, are a promising concept that has proven to be effective in increasing the overall resilience performance in sewer systems. However, the improvement is not always significant or guaranteed. There is a lack of understanding of the local effects of these infrastructures and the spatial components of the impact on resilience in the network.In this work, the spatial interactions between GI placement and improvements in the centralized sewer networks resilience were studied, whilst considering a wide range of design storms. Resilience is assessed using two metrics: flood volume and flood duration. The scenarios simulated were baseline scenarios with no green infrastructure for each rainfall (scenarios type 1) and a placement scheme using critical component analysis (scenarios type 2). The spatial interactions were analysed through three main points, the magnitude of the impact, the number of affected nodes and the location of the impact in the network. This analysis was applied in a case-study in the United Kingdom.Regarding the magnitude of the impact, even though at a system level the impact is not high, at a node level the impact can be significant. Also, the impact is higher in shorter duration and lower return period storms. Regarding the number of affected nodes, most of the nodes remain unchanged. When all the scenarios are considered, there are as many nodes with an increase, as there are with a decrease in flooding volume and duration. Regarding the location of the impact, the nearest nodes to the outlet show the highest reduction in flood volume and flood duration. Subcatchments upstream the network and with highest areas seem to be the most impactful in the flood volume change. For flood duration, the subcatchments with smaller areas and generally in a middle region in the network cause the highest changes.This study is a first approximation to understand spatial considerations regarding the impact on resilience based on different green infrastructure location in the network.},

	abstract = {Software Engineering researchers and practitioners have sought a systematic way of characterizing technical and social behaviors in software development, from the perspective of either an artifact (e.g. design pattern) or an actor (e.g. developer). In this context, influencers are those who guide the development methods and disseminate patterns due to their popularity or status in the community. Especially in software ecosystems, the dynamics of interactions with interventions of external developers over a common technological platform leverage the effects of influence and still remains as a challenge. This paper presents an exploratory study on the sense of influence in open source software ecosystems, more specifically from the opinions of 95 developers who contribute to npm projects based on GitHub. To do so, qualitative data from a conducted survey research were analyzed based on Grounded Theory (GT) procedures. Based on two main categories (Technical and Social), we recognized aspects that reinforce some key characteristics of an influencer, e.g., 'status in the project', 'participation with code', 'participation with comments ', and 'content value'. However, some diverging aspects were observed, e.g., the difference between qualitative and quantitative responses related to 'long-time interaction with the project'. This study contributes with the identification of influencers' characteristics that can aid both researchers in further studies on open source software ecosystems and practitioners in strategies to manage project-based ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Organizations that produce software cooperatively and competitively to satisfy customer needs give more attention in relationships among several actors (e.g., providers, developers, and IT managers) to build the value creation network called Software Ecosystem (SECO). As a type of SECO, proprietary SECO concerns data concentrated on a platform with contributions protected by intellectual property. The technological platform that supports the business initiatives is developed using different technologies with dozens of integration points, promoting a network of dependencies and architectural complexities. Some studies show that systems downtime (incidents) causes major image and financial upheavals for organizations. To mitigate the risks of incidents, the IT management team should implement strategies based on governance mechanisms to sustain the platform. Our work aims to develop and evaluate a process-based approach (PSECO-IM) for incident management to support the IT management team in the governance of a technology platform architecture in a proprietary SECO. We also addressed some of the identified challenges of quality in proprietary SECO, such as standardized software processes, knowledge management, and governance strategies. As a final result, we got positive feedback on the relevance of the tool in improving governance strategies related to incident management by the organization's practitioners. We argue that this work is appropriate for the Software Quality area since it covers studies on three pillars: people, process, and technology, such as tacit knowledge, low-quality software, governance, incident management, and proprietary SECO.},

	abstract = {Change introduces conflict into software ecosystems: breaking changes may ripple through the ecosystem and trigger rework for users of a package, but often developers can invest additional effort or accept opportunity costs to alleviate or delay downstream costs. We performed a multiple case study of three software ecosystems with different tooling and philosophies toward change, Eclipse, R/CRAN, and Node.js/npm, to understand how developers make decisions about change and change-related costs and what practices, tooling, and policies are used. We found that all three ecosystems differ substantially in their practices and expectations toward change and that those differences can be explained largely by different community values in each ecosystem. Our results illustrate that there is a large design space in how to build an ecosystem, its policies and its supporting infrastructure; and there is value in making community values and accepted tradeoffs explicit and transparent in order to resolve conflicts and negotiate change-related costs.},

	abstract = {Digitalization and servitization are impacting many domains, including the mining industry. As the equipment becomes connected and technical infrastructure evolves, business models and risk management need to adapt. In this paper, we present a study on how changes in asset and risk distribution are evolving for the actors in a software ecosystem (SECO) and system-of-systems (SoS) around a mining operation. We have performed a survey to understand how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) -- a common mechanism for managing risk -- are used in other domains. Furthermore, we have performed a focus group study with companies. There is an overall trend in the mining industry to move the investment cost (CAPEX) from the mining operator to the vendors. Hence, the mining operator instead leases the equipment (as operational expense, OPEX) or even acquires a service. This change in business model impacts operation, as knowledge is moved from the mining operator to the suppliers. Furthermore, as the infrastructure becomes more complex, this implies that the mining operator is more and more reliant on the suppliers for the operation and maintenance. As this change is still in an early stage, there is no formalized risk management, e.g. through SLAs, in place. Rather, at present, the companies in the ecosystem rely more on trust and the incentives created by the promise of mutual future benefits of innovation activities. We believe there is a need to better understand how to manage risk in SECO as it is established and evolves. At the same time, in a SECO, the focus is on cooperation and innovation, the companies do not have incentives to address this unless there is an incident. Therefore, industry need, we believe, help in systematically understanding risk and defining quality aspects such as reliability and performance in the new business environment.},

He does not further tolerate an exploitative system that comes at the expense of people, animals, the environment, and the climate, and pleads for more appreciation and value creation for farmers. One approach to address this issue is the provision of authenticated, traceable, and irreversible data about the food origin and production process. This paper presents the methods, experiences and results of a project that examined in cooperation with relevant stakeholders the technical possibilities of a data space that provides production and process data to the customer. An integral part of this data space is a blockchain module that ensures the traceability and irreversibility of the data. The paper contributes to research on blockchain application in governmental systems that provide trustful information in a food data space and it provides insights in to the concerns of different stakeholders as well as their role in the overall governance of a blockchain supported data space.},

	abstract = {The process of transferring technology from research institutes to industry involves benchmarking it in exhaustive experiments to assure it reaches the established quality criteria. This is also true for the livestock domain, in which the technologies developed to sustainably raise animals production are submitted to experiments while preserving their health and wellness. However, since such institutions often conduct several parallel innovation projects, the establishment of an infrastructure to support those experiments can be costly, repetitive, and error-prone. For that purpose, we developed E-SECO, a software ecosystem that encapsulates a life-cycle model for scientific experiments and its supporting platform and actors. The main contribution of this paper is presenting how the E-SECO architecture was successfully applied to create a livestock architecture (named e-Livestock architecture) from which two different (and independent) scientific experiments involving real systems were deployed and executed in the livestock domain. The first experiment involved a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place; whilst the second experiment involved an automated monitoring environment for aviaries. Preliminary results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract concepts of scientific experiments for livestock domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of an architecture to support engineering real systems for different livestock sub-domains, and (iii) support the experiments towards a future transfer of technology to industry.},

Cloudera is healthier in terms of robustness and niche creation, while Hortonworks is healthier in terms of productivity. Financially, Cloudera performs better than Hortonworks. Conclusion. The following hypotheses are formulated. Software ecosystem health has an expected positive relation with financial performance. Niche creation health is the main contributor to this relation, robustness health is a minor reason for this relation, and software ecosystem productivity health has little to no influence.},

	abstract = {Context: Web portals play an important role within a Software Ecosystem (SECO), as they facilitate access to information and interaction among software developers over a common technological platform. Problem: Developers' dissatisfaction with how information is presented on the SECO portal affects their engagement within the platform, causing a migration to consume information and interact in third-party channels, harming the SECO business model. Solution: This paper presents factors that influence developers' search and information consumption on SECO technological platforms and suggestions that keystones can implement to increase engagement and transparency in their portals. IS Theory: This work was conceived under the Social Media Engagement Theory, regarding the transparency dimension in social interactions between users and platform technical resources. In this case, users are developers who seek knowledge about a SECO platform technology. Method: We conducted a survey with developers to understand their information consumption in SECO portals. Results were analyzed from quantitative and qualitative approaches. Summary of Results: From 50 responses, we identified three sets of categories associated with factors that influence developers on where to seek knowledge about a SECO technological platform (SECO portals or third-party channels) and we made three suggestions for keystones to increase engagement and transparency in their SECO portals. Contributions and Impact in the IS field: The main contribution is to favor developers' engagement and transparency in information consumption and interaction within SECO portals.

This approach answers the question, "What should this software system do, while contributing to overall sustainability?" This paper considers how sustainability impacts the requirements engineering process for a software system for medication adherence. The examined system, Project Cognatio, is targeted toward outpatient medical practices with the goal to improve medication adherence among patients. We found considering the dimensions of sustainability can significantly enrich a number of RE artifacts and thereby inform system's design. This analysis proves useful for the future development of Project Cognatio and shows that RE4S can improve software development's contribution to sustainability.},

Hence, additional hardware accelerators based on Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) or FPGAs are required to process those large amounts of data. In this paper, our hardware/software co-design concept is presented, which allows for the integration of hardware accelerators realized in FPGAs, to improve overall system performance. We can access the accelerators from the widely used GNU Radio, which also allows non-FPGA user to benefit from the acceleration. For this purpose, a concept to share data between Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic (PL) is developed and evaluated regarding its suitability for high bandwidth applications. Using a common application for evaluation, we are able to compare a hardware/software co-design with an entirely software-based implementation. Resulting in an overall performance increase by a factor of up to 4.5, while serving as a foundation for an easy-to-use method for hardware accelerators in GNU Radio.},

	abstract = {The information system was developed to aid the critical operations of the enhanced national greening program within the Caraga region, eliminate the risk of human error, and lift the tedious manual processing and progress monitoring. However, the sudden shift of processes from manual to automated information systems can affect the user adoption of the system. For this reason, a survey was conducted eight (8) months after the software development to assess and evaluate the development and implementation of the information system adopting the Delone and Mclean IS Success Model and hypothesizing nine (9) relationships to examine the information system success. This work used Fornell-Lacker's Criterion to measure the discriminant validity of the constructs - Information Quality, Intention to Use, Perceived Net Benefits, System Quality, Service Quality, and User Satisfaction. Results show that the intention to use positively affects Perceived Net Benefits. Moreover, Service Quality and User Satisfaction affect users' Intention to Use; evidently, the user's perceptions of the quality of the services delivered and service performance are motivating factors for users' continued use of the system. Lastly, user satisfaction, intention, system quality, and quality of service are contributory factors that affect the usage and adoption of the system.},

But a lot of valuable software is the product of evolution, reuse, and reengineering. Some software is too expensive to "throw away and start over." A skilled software team will have an arsenal of techniques at their disposal for adapting, evolving, and refactoring existing code and designs. Adapting legacy software is a kind of recycling. If extending a legacy system is done well, it can help deliver business value sooner at a lower cost.This workshop will explore some old and new techniques for building on existing code -- wrapper classes, design patterns, test-driven approaches, refactoring tools, and others. The workshop will also address management issues: what factors to consider in the decision to reengineer or to build anew. This workshop revisits a topic discussed in an OOPSLA 2003 workshop.},

	abstract = {Large-scale and increasingly software-defined systems in power and factory automation are very long-lived. Longevity requires sustainability - economically, environmentally and last but not least in terms of usability. Sustainability therefore requires continuous change. In this talk we look at handling requirements, models, and implementations in a model-driven formal way that lends itself to a more systematic change tracking than 'traditional' software development approaches and languages, but that also crosses boundaries of software-controlled physical equipment models (so-called cyber-physical systems), distributed digital control (networked systems) and software services.The industry is currently seeing a rapid development of cyber-physical system products. The systems that are developed have increasing demands of sustainability, dependability and usability. Moreover, lead time and cost efficiency continue to be essential for industry competitiveness. Extensive use of modeling and simulation - Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools - throughout the value chain and system life-cycle is one of the most important ways to effectively target these challenges. Simultaneously there is an increased interest in open source tools that allow more control of tool features and support, and increased cooperation and shared access to knowledge and innovations between organizations.In this talk we briefly present technology and open source tooling for MBSE based on the Modelica and UML standards, supported by tools such as OpenModelica and Papyrus respectively. Modelica is a modern, strongly typed, declarative, equation-based, and object-oriented language for modeling and simulation of complex cyber-physical systems, whereas UML is a wide-spread industrial standard for software modeling.We present the OpenModelica open source MBSE environment including the ModelicaML Eclipse plug-in integrating Modelica and UML, covering the development process starting from business processes, via requirements, to models, which can be compiled to simulations or to product code. An important question is whether a particular system design fulfills or violates requirements that are imposed on the system under development. We give examples of case studies starting with natural-language requirements and show briefly how they are translated into models. Then, designs and verification scenarios are modeled, and simulation models are composed and simulated automatically. The simulation results produced can then be used to draw conclusions on requirement fulfillment. Other features of the environment are meta modeling for efficient model transformations, the Functional Mockup Interface for general tool integration, model-based optimization, as well as generation of parallel code for multi-core architectures.},

GreenLA is (1) energy efficient: it saves up to several times more energy than the best existing energy saving approaches that do not modify library source codes; (2) high performance: its performance is comparable to the highly optimized linear algebra library MAGMA; and (3) transparent to applications: with the same programming interface, existing MAGMA users do not need to modify their source codes to benefit from GreenLA. Experimental results demonstrate that GreenLA is able to save up to three times more energy than the best existing energy saving approaches while delivering similar performance compared to the state-of-the-art linear algebra library MAGMA.},

	abstract = {Ecologists instrument ecosystems to collect time series representing the evolution in time and space of relevant abiotic and biotic factors. Sensor networks promise to improve on existing data acquisition systems by interconnecting stand-alone measurement systems into virtual instruments. Such ecological sensor networks, however, will only fulfill their potential if they meet the scientists requirements. In an ideal world, an ecologist expresses requirements in terms of a target dataset, which the sensor network then actually collects and stores. In fact, failures occur and interesting events happen, making uniform systematic ecosystem sampling neither possible nor desirable. Today, these anomalous situations are handled as exceptions treated by technicians that receive an alert at deployment time. In this paper, we detail how ecological sensor networks can maximize the utility of the collected datasets in a changing environment. More specifically, we present the design of a controller that continuously maintains its state based on the data obtained from the sensor network (as well as external systems), and configures motes with parameters that satisfy a constraint optimization problem derived from the current state, the system requirements, and the scientist requirements. We describe our implementation, discuss its scalability, and discuss its performance in the context of two case studies.},

In this work, the effect of the non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation of BTS (Base Transceiver Station) and the Wi-Fi access points on our ecological system has been investigated over frequency band 900 MHz to 2500 MHz. A testbed is designed utilizing sensors to measure the EMF strength over a given region, and a heat map is generated. Using the standard safe limit of specific absorption rate (SAR) this heat map may enable us to issue alerts whenever the measured EMF exceeds the SAR limit. The stream of data from these sensors may be uploaded on a cloud to implement an adaptive transmitter power control mechanism to reduce the signal strength dynamically to maintain the safe limit of SAR. A modular design is proposed to implement a cloud-based transmission power control mechanism that can be applied for BTS as well as Wi-Fi routers in cellular networks.},

Activity-centric computing (ACC) systems attempt to address this problem by organizing activity-related artifacts together. But are ACC systems effective at reducing fragmentation? In this paper, we present a two-part study of workers using Lotus Activities, an ACC system deployed for over two years in a large company. First, we surveyed workers to understand the ecology of workplace tools they use for various tasks. Second, we interviewed 22 Lotus Activities users to investigate how this ACC tool fits amongst their ecology of existing collaboration tools and affects work fragmentation. Our results indicate that Lotus Activities works in concert with certain other tools to successfully ease fragmentation for a specific type of activity. We identify design characteristics that contribute to this result.},

This study investigates the interactive and feedback relationship between land use and transportation system from the perspective of access management. By integrating the land use and traffic data from Las Vegas Metropolitan area with the system dynamics model, the causal relationship and causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are introduced to analyze the cause-and-effect relationship and quantitative relationship between the factors of the combined system of land use and transportation, and then sub-models partition and system simulation are performed. The systems dynamics model is established by analyzing the relationship between a series of access management techniques, traffic characteristics, and land use features. The results show that system dynamics model can be used as an effective alternative to model the symbiosis relationship of land use and transportation system for urban planning and construction.Introduction},

	abstract = {Identifying fall risk can prevent injuries in the elderly as well as reduce the related financial burden. A balance assessment, Timed Up and Go (TUG), has been widely applied to estimate fall risk. However, the standardized TUG usually excludes complex factors (e.g. slopes and obstacles) falling short of representing challenges in environments that many older adults navigate. Having information on the motor performance in more complex settings can better inform clinicians about an individual's risk of falling. To this end, we present Smart Insole TUG (SITUG), a cost-efficient, real-time and self-assessment system suitable for the complex environmental TUG. Based on the human stride mechanism, our SITUG educes four refined aspects in the gait feature and segments the TUG process by six detailed phases, providing accurate and advanced information for the fall risk estimation. We evaluate the system with four complex environmental TUG. The results show that the SITUG achieves mean accuracy 94.1% in extracting subcomponents within a stride and 93.13% in deriving the stride length based on the verification of estimated walking distance. Moreover, this system can distinguish six TUG phases with the correctness around 90%.},

Advances in software, hardware, and telecommunications linked to design are enabling millions of people to share greater content in multimedia devices of smaller size and costs. Now, the real success of a multimedia product, commercial or not, lies in the communicability of that content. Communicability that is not synonymous with usability and which entails the notion of quality.Inside that global village, human beings create content that runs through both on-line and off-line multimedia systems in a myriad of sites that refer to the present, the future and the past. This diachronic interactive vision favours the promotion of cultural patrimony, for instance. A patrimony immersed in nature. Therefore, a bidirectional relationship must exist between cultural and ecological heritage. An excellent example is Vancouver city and the Canadian nation where our workshop takes place. The symbiosis between new technologies and respect for nature in an endless number of cases is perfect.The purpose of the current workshop is not only to try to set down the theoretical bases for the notion of communicability as a result of the intersection of the formal and fact sciences, but also a series of theoretical-practical examples will make it possible to know the state of the arts in design, the assessment of quality of the multimedia systems aimed at the promotion of cultural and natural heritage, the drawing of the profile of a new professional in the qualitative context of the multimedia systems, future trends in the net under the denomination of Web 3.0, heuristic analysis of the classical supports in multimedia aimed at tourism and entertainment, virtual museums, the nearness of the citizen to his/her local institutions, and quality in vocal communications through the internet, among so many other aspects which tend to increase the communicability, the design and the heuristic assessment of it, in the framework of ecological and cultural heritage of multimedia systems.},

This diversity makes it significant and challenging for sustainability to be quantified and measured. While the existence of perfect sustainability indicators is relatively unreasonable, they have important pragmatic roles in quantification and measurement by bridging sustainability's three pillars. Information system (IS) and sustainability are popular research areas, which clearly reflect the divergent and multidimensional role of sustainability. Despite this importance, defining the right sustainability indicators for IS is imperceptible. In this paper, we have identified sustainability indicators for IS using previous theoretical frameworks where universal design (UD) and its advance concept were used. Followed by this, a framework of IS sustainability indicators were proposed. The indicators were shown in the form of a design space arrangement, which could play significant roles in assessing sustainability for IS.},

	abstract = {Sustainability assessment is a multi-faceted, dynamic, and complex paradigm in the context of buildings with several social, economic and environmental interactions. Hence, the building sector lacks a robust sustainability evaluation and benchmarking mechanism. Consequently, a system thinking approach can solve these challenges due to its ability to evaluate complex systems. Therefore, this paper presents a methodological framework for sustainability benchmarking of buildings using the system dynamics modeling and simulation technique. The proposed methodology captures the dynamic trade-offs between the sustainability dimensions associated with a building while evaluating various policy scenarios for improvement. Further, through a series of system simulations, a benchmarking scale is developed to indicate the sustainability of the building as high, medium, and low levels based on the defined criteria. Results indicate the sustainability behavior of different buildings in comparison to achievable industry benchmarks for the building type evaluated while recommending measures for improvement to achieve better sustainability.},

The system initially rewards the user with direct playful interactions when depositing clothes in the recycling machine, followed by dispensing a token granting access to a user specific website further depicting what happens to their recycled clothes. To close the loop, a clothing line is created from the supplied textiles. This paper addresses the design of the system to encourage sustainable fashion and textile awareness amongst young adults, including the sustainability challenges, playful strategy used and the studies that informed the system, namely an interview study with 30 participants between 18 and 25 years old. Furthermore, preliminary lessons learned are presented from the design and evaluation of the system.},

Even simple messaging services would be of great help for example to farmers wishing to know the price of a certain good they are interested to sell or buy before deciding whether a possibly long, expensive and exhausting trip is undertaken.In this paper we describe a low-cost and low-power system based on the LoRa protocol to provide a messaging system without being subject to recurring costs. LoRa networks allow for very long wireless links that can connect villages and towns. In addition to the simple messaging application, LoRa can be used to distribute sensor information to communities or to provide disaster alerts. This system falls in the category of community networks, where users build their own network as no infrastructure is available.},

Nature including animals and plants supplies various information acoustically and visually. In this context, we present the concept of Cicada Fingerprinting System, which is a future localization scheme that will enable us to make the most of the information from nature. In our system, users collect the chirp of cicadas as acoustic data via smartphone embedded with microphone. Using the chirp of cicadas such as Wi-Fi fingerprinting, we can specify the location of users regardless of the existence of a roof. That is to say, cicada fingerprinting system applies cicada's instinctive behaviour to a localization. Furthermore, by our system, users are able to feel a sense of belonging to a nature even in urban area, where we spend much time in daily life. This novel system is designed for making general users conscious of presence of nature around.},

	abstract = {Sustainable Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a heterogeneous developing field of research, typically focusing on persuasive system design to influence users to behave and live more sustainably. So far this change of behavior towards sustainability has been limited more or less within the scope of environmental topics. This paper extends the notion of sustainable HCI beyond the ecological sphere of sustainability. This paper has followed a previous research work in which sustainable system design principles were formulated without explanation of how to practice them in a system development process. Design principles originating from HCI design principles are an approach to showing how they could influence the classical system development life cycle to produce a sustainable system. A theoretical framework is proposed to explain this. Then sustainable HCI is redefined from the perspective of different parameters associated within the universal design concept from HCI.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/1122935.1122937,
	abstract = {One of the fundamental aims of system design is to make the user unaware of a system's presence. You only become aware of something when it has gone wrong. And yet there is a paradox here. In order to design a system that is transparent to the user we seem to need to be completely aware of it and of its deep structure. This paradox is associated with what is known as the 'problem of mapping'. This is the problem of how to move from abstract representations of tasks, knowledge and data structures to a concrete representation of the structure of dialogues and interactions required for a specific implementation. In this paper I review some of the history of a different field of design -- architecture -- in its search for design methodologies. Using that history I suggest that underlying the paradox lies a paradigm -- a set of ideas tha we think with rather than of -- in which some of our most deeply held assumptions may be at fault. In particular I suggest that the established task modelling approach assumes as basic the distinction between user and system, while for any 'well working' system the user must actually become literally embedded. That is, the distinction between user and system should, from the user's point of view, effectively disappear. I suggest that this sort of disappearance can result from consideration of design in terms of designing and managing ecologies. I illustrate this with studies of health buildings. This suggestion seems to be in line with recent thinking in both philosophy and cognitive science, however it does raise serious questions for methodology in engineering design -- by which I mean in the broadest sense, systems which appear purposive. I conclude that as computing becomes pervasive, methods in which design is considered as a form of 'reflective practice' may need to be adopted in systems design.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to present an energy-conserving, self-adaptive Commodity Green Cloud Storage, called Lightning. Lightning's File System dynamically configures the servers in the Cloud Storage into logical Hot and Cold Zones. Lightning uses data-classification driven data placement to realize guaranteed, substantially long, periods (several days) of idleness in a significant subset of servers designated as the Cold Zone, in the commodity datacenter backing the Cloud Storage. These servers are then transitioned to inactive power modes and the resulting energy savings substantially reduce the operating costs of the datacenter. Furthermore, the energy savings allow Lightning to improve the data access performance by incorporation of high-performance, though high-cost Solid State Drives (SSD) without exceeding the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the datacenter. Analytical cost model analysis of Lightning suggests savings in the upwards of $24 million in the TCO of a 20,000 server datacenter.

	abstract = {Research software has opened up new pathways of discovery in many and diverse disciplines. This research software is developed under unique budgetary and schedule constraints. Its development is driven by knowledge discovery goals often without documented requirements. As a result, the software code quality is impacted which often hinders its sustainability beyond the immediate research goals. More importantly, the prevalent reward structures favor contributions in terms of research articles and systematically undervalues research codes contributions. As a result, researchers and funding agencies do not allocate appropriate efforts or resources to the development, sustenance, and dissemination of research codebases. This paper presents Susereum, a Blockchain based platform that aims at achieving two goals. First, restructuring prevalent incentives by awarding permanent immutable credit to research code authors similar to the credit awarded to the authors of scientific articles. Second, distributing sovereignty by empowering peers through a consensus process to define code sustainability and impact metrics.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing the performance of a latency-insensitive system (LIS) where the addition of backpressure has caused throughput degradation. Previous works have addressed the problem of LIS performance in different ways. In particular, the insertion of relay stations and the sizing of the input queues in the shells are the two main optimization techniques that have been proposed. We provide a unifying framework for this problem by outlining which approaches work for different system topologies, and highlighting counterexamples where some solutions do not work. We also observe that in the most difficult class of topologies, instances with the greatest throughput degradation are typically very amenable to simplifications. The contributions of this paper include a characterization of topologies that maintain optimal throughput with fixed-size queues and a heuristic for sizing queues that produces solutions close to optimal in a fraction of the time.},

Here, information and communication technologies (ICT) offer significant new ways to support social activism in cities by providing residents with new digital tools to articulate projects and mobilize activities. However, the development of ICT for activism is still in its infancy, with activists using basic tools stitched together in an ad hoc manner for their needs. Still, Internet-based technologies and related software architectures feature various enablers for civic action beyond base social networking. To that end, this paper discusses the vision and initial details of AppCivist, a platform that builds on cross-domain research among social scientists and computer scientists to revisit service-oriented architecture and relevant services to further social activism.

	abstract = {There is a growing trend for employing cyber-physical systems to help smart homes improve the comfort of residents. However, a residential cyber-physical system is different from a common cyber-physical system since it directly involves human interaction, which is full of uncertainty. The existing solutions could be effective for performance enhancement in some cases when no inherent and dominant human factors are involved. Besides, the rapidly rising interest in the deployments of cyber-physical systems at home does not normally integrate with energy management schemes, which is a central issue that smart homes have to face. In this article, we propose a cyber-physical-system-based energy management framework to enable a sustainable-edge computing paradigm while meeting the needs of home energy management and residents. This framework aims to enable the full use of renewable energy while reducing electricity bills for households. A prototype system was implemented using real-world hardware. The experiment results demonstrated that renewable energy is fully capable of supporting the reliable running of home appliances most of the time and electricity bills could be cut by up to 60% when our proposed framework was employed.},

The model takes into account the main components of the social environment, together with their relations with the hydrological cycle. Population was estimated with the Cohort-Component method, domestic, industrial and livestock use was calculated with standard coefficients, while agricultural use was estimated with the Blaney-Criddle method. The hydrological model involved estimated monthly runoff with the Curve Number method. Precipitation was modeled in a disaggregate manner, first annual rainfall was modeled with spatially correlated lognormal random variables and these variables are used to generate monthly precipitations with the fragments method. Percolation coefficients were used to estimate aquifer's recharge. Water supply took into account the main reservoirs and aquifers in the region, together with water treatment and reuse. In the scenario construction phase, ten critical variables were selected and integrated in three basic scenarios. Results showed that in spite of a recent major inter-basin transfer, overexploitation of the main aquifer will continue in two of those scenarios, reinforcing the idea that demand administration measures are necessary to complement future supplies of water.},

	abstract = {Urban arterial traffic coordination control catches great attention in the process of smart city construction. To achieve the optimum signal timing, many studies attempt to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between the road intersections. However, the existing green wave traffic control system usually has a sophisticated calculation, which depends upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, leading to weak robustness. Therefore, this short paper puts forward ES-Band, that is, a novel approach to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence. ES-Band introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters for searching the optimal value by CMA-ES. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ES-Band, we import the real traffic flow data of Zhongshan Road in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into traffic environment simulator for training and carry out a series of experiments. The results have shown that the ES-Band outperforms the traditional methods in terms of a better convergence, lower travel time, and fewer stops.},

	abstract = {One efficient way to perceive the effects of design decisions is by analyzing and evaluating Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). A design decison can contribute positively or negatively toward specific NFRs. In their turn, NFRs describe how the software operates, representing essential quality characteristics of the software systems. In addition, the typical way of perceiving the ``quality'' of a software ecosystem is through the concept of ecosystem health and its health indicators. Considering the descriptive nature of NFRs representing a quality characteristic of the system, they could be a feasible way to know ecosystem health. Through their connection with the health indicators, it is possible to sketch paths to understand the influence of the NFRs on the health indicators and realize how the ecosystem health perceives the design decisions. This study aims to understand and map influences from NFRs to health indicators based on evidence found in KDE, a real-world ecosystem. We conducted mixed-methods research, including a survey with ecosystem experts and an adapted practitioner-evidence framework. Findings present a high-level descriptive mapping with connections between NFRs and health indicators, besides explaining evidence found in the KDE ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Programming is usually based on an inconvenient separation between an implementation level and a user level. Self-sustaining systems expose their implementation at their user level so that they can be modified and improved from within. However, the few examples that exist are tightly linked to textual language-based accounts of compiler bootstrapping. If we want systems to be truly open for modification, we need to step beyond programming languages and support more structured, visual ways of programming as well. How the bootstrapping process can work in such an interactive context is important yet unexplored territory. This essay is a critical report on our first-hand experience of building one such system named BootstrapLab. We trace and reconstruct the steps for achieving self-sustainability in an interactive, structured, graphical context: choose the platform; design the substrate; implement temporary infrastructure; implement a high-level language; pay off outstanding substrate debt; provide for domain-specific notations. Throughout, we discuss the challenges involved, identifying design forces that shaped the decisions and capturing heuristics that resolved these forces in our case. Both positive and negative results are featured, including the efficacy of the heuristics. We close by suggesting how to generalise what worked in our particular case to alternative paths and starting points. The enterprise as a whole takes us a further step towards achieving open and malleable programming systems for everyone.},

System on chip power requirement for the internet of things (IoT) and generating higher voltages on chip is a massive challenge for on-chip peripherals and systems. In this article, an on-chip reliable energy-harvesting system (EHS) is designed for IoT with an inductor-free methodology. The control section monitors the computational load and the recharging of the battery/super-capacitor. An efficient maximum power point tracking algorithm is also used to avoid quiescent power consumption. The reliability of the proposed EHS is improved by using an aging tolerant ring oscillator. The effect of Trojan on the performance of energy-harvesting system is analyzed, and proper detection and mitigation mechanism is proposed. Finally, the proposed ripple mitigation techniques further improves the performance of the aging sensor. The proposed EHS is designed and simulated in CMOS 90-nm technology. The output voltage is in the range of 3--3.55 V with an input 1--1.5 V with a power throughput of 0--22 μW. The EHS consumes power under the ultra-low-power requirements of IoT smart nodes.},

	abstract = {The importance of project-based learning has increased. However, existing systems and methods have not been effective enough at taking advantage of past experiences for progressive learning, which is one of the most promising approaches. In practical work situations, suggesting and recalling experiences with intuitive expressions such as "like that case" is often successful. In this research, we focused on the fact that examining learning/teaching strategies tend to close by each piece of work and issue. To solve this problem, we developed methods for accumulating and organizing documents and work histories involved with research activities. In this paper, we mainly describe a system for organizing the experience cases into visual sheets. We also discuss the characteristics of our methods on the basis of the results of experiments.},

Wind turbines (WTs), solar photovoltaics (PVs), a substation with grid access, and a net metering system are included in the generation system. WTs and solar PVs have the highest priority in supplying the daily electricity of the wafer fab. Surplus energy can be returned to the main grid. The objective function of the production planning formulation contains production-related costs, cost for energy from the substation, and penalty costs when a renewable energy penetration is not reached. This cost can be reduced by offering renewable surplus energy to the main grid. The obtained production plans are executed in a simulation environment to compute the expected profit in the face of machine breakdowns, wind power volatility, and uncertain power output of the solar PVs. The approach allows determining an appropriate number of WTs and solar PVs for given demand scenarios. We present results of simulation experiments with the proposed model.},

The objectives of our research work are to design and construct expert systems software that can produce enhanced explanations in expert systems for use in the ecological domain.Our first effort was the identification of the functional requirements of explanation that were relevant to ecologists. Three needs were identified: demonstration of the relationships between the specific kinds of uncertainty modeled in the ecological reasoning process, quantification of the effect which these kinds of uncertainty have on the conclusions of the system, and identification of ``critical states'' in this reasoning process. The second effort was the design of efficient software modules for integrating these requirements into existing expert systems.We present an explanatory technique which can analyze and present the model of the reasoning process, used by expert ecologists in a way which can be easily related to practicalities such as the allocation of priorities, and, a mechanism to identify and analyze points in this reasoning process that become relatively critical during a consultation.},

	abstract = {With an increasing demand to manage biological resources even when the supporting systems undergo significant changes there is great need for ecological models which take into account all system levels relevant to the resource. However, the large ecological models rising to this challenge require expertise from, at times, quite distinct branches of science. Therefore, rather than tasking a single individual or working group to expand models beyond their area of expertise, fusing smaller submodels into large complex ones appears as a natural way forward. We propose to ensure the semantic validity of the fused models by carefully interlinking composition and validation steps exploiting earlier simulation experiments. A simulation model of the cod in the Baltic sea will elucidate the approach as the different aspects of respiration, energy budgets and behaviour are fused and validated as a whole after being modeled and validated individually.},

In this paper, we describe current design practices, and reflect on the design approaches that characterize avatars and avatar systems in this emerging commercial sector. To investigate design approaches to avatar systems and their impact on communication and interaction with people within this medium, we interviewed industry experts associated with a range of platforms including Rec Room, AltspaceVR, High Fidelity, VRChat, Anyland, and Mozilla Hubs. In analyzing the ways that design choices shape embodied experience, we map design approaches to avatar systems in this evolving landscape and make preliminary claims about the impact of these varying design approaches.},

	abstract = {The representation used by a learning algorithm introduces a bias which is more or less well-suited to any given learning problem. It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature: hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.},

	abstract = {This paper reframes algorithmic systems as intimately connected to and part of social and ecological systems, and proposes a first-of-its-kind methodology for environmental justice-oriented algorithmic audits. How do we consider environmental and climate justice dimensions of the way algorithmic systems are designed, developed, and deployed? These impacts are inherently emergent and can only be understood and addressed at the level of relations between an algorithmic system and the social (including institutional) and ecological components of the broader ecosystem it operates in. As a result, we claim that in absence of an integral ontology for algorithmic systems, we cannot do justice to the emergent nature of broader environmental impacts of algorithmic systems and their underlying computational infrastructure. Furthermore, an integral lens provides many lessons from the history of environmental justice that are of relevance in current day struggles for algorithmic justice. We propose to define algorithmic systems as ontologically indistinct from Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS), framing emergent implications as couplings between social, ecological, and technical components of the broader fabric in which algorithms are integrated and operate. We draw upon prior work on SETS analysis as well as emerging themes in the literature and practices of Environmental Justice (EJ) to conceptualize and assess algorithmic impact. We then offer three policy recommendations to help establish a SETS-based EJ approach to algorithmic audits: (1) broaden the inputs and open-up the outputs of an audit, (2) enable meaningful access to redress, and (3) guarantee a place-based and relational approach to the process of evaluating impact. We operationalize these as a qualitative framework of questions for a spectrum of stakeholders. Doing so, this article aims to inspire stronger and more frequent interactions across policymakers, researchers, practitioners, civil society, and grassroots communities. https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05733.},

The metrics use a series of primitives for the design which stem from the design models of the hypermedia but in our case they have been suited to communicability, resorting to the use of semiotics and other disciplines of the formal and factual sciences. The use of metrics does not require labs, special equipment, etc., because they are used by a new professional known as an heuristic assessor of communicability.},

Examining both Cybernetic and Autonomic Computing techniques we evolve a set-theory oriented, atomically-derived, emergent model that reflects an algorithmic decomposition of Beer's recursive, multi-agent Viable System Model, pertinent by its composition of multiple and independent entities, sharing one or more objectives. Integrated management promotes each sub-system as a whole within a closed ecological meta-boundary. The relationships between sub-systems is demonstrated via syntax subscripts, while the relationship linking recursive levels is recognized via superscripts. The resultant design grammar endorses autonomy versus governance, exploiting cybernetic, biological and mathematical metaphors, crucially seeking inherent learning and control through system-environment interplay. Focusing on interactions and inter-relationships, the self-organizing environments exhibit evolution of systemic elements, conserving yet managing resources provided by each entity. Research ultimately aspires augm entation of the Autonomic Computing state of the art into the original field of Viable Computing Systems.},

These models are typically abstract and simple to aid with performance. However, they can lack fidelity and detail, particularly with regards to physical aspects. This makes it challenging to extract valuable and accurate data from these models, such as sustainability metrics. Our approach to this problem is to employ a Cyber-Physical Systems Model-Based Design methodology that enables the use of various specialised multi-disciplinary models through Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and a common integration platform based on SysML. We apply the approach to a heating, ventilation and air conditioning case study and show how the resulting data can be used to evaluate a design. In addition, we discuss how the approach supports the inclusion of dedicated models for the generation of precise sustainability metrics.},

The IoE network must integrate embedded devices, people, processes and data in order to provide relevant information for various application areas such as medical, industry, aerospace, agrobusiness, automation, education, among others. In this paper, we propose an acknowledged System of Systems (SoS) to integrate IoE ecosystems that operate into educational environments. This SoS implements a service-oriented architecture to provide services as interfaces between constituent systems (CS). A CS is mediated by a negotiator agent that can be requested by the SoS coordinator agent to identify the availability of specific resources demanded by other CS. This coordinator agent is responsible for recommending the CS with the best available resource for the requester CS and providing information about how access it. All the IoE components also may be mediated by intelligent agents thus increasing the robustness of an IoE ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Architectural Sustainability refers to the ability of an architecture to achieve its goals while sustaining its value on dimensions related to environmental, social, economic, individual and/or technical during its operation and evolution. While the process of architectural design implies a fit between the requirements, system conditions and constraints; incomplete information and uncertainty may increase the cost of the architecture, introduce risks, alter its value and influence the extent to which it can evolve and sustain. We propose an economics-driven architectural evaluation method which extends the Cost Benefits Analysis Method (CBAM) and integrates principles of modern portfolio theory to control the risks when linking sustainability concern to architectural design decisions. The method aims at identifying portfolio(s) of architecture design decisions which are more promising for adding/delivering value while reducing risk on the sustainability dimensions. The method quantifies the sustainability debt of these decisions. The ultimate goal is to develop an objective decision-support framework for reasoning about sustainability requirements in relation architecture decisions in the presence of uncertainty. We evaluate the approach with an Emergency Deployment System (EDS). The results show that the method can make the value, cost and risks of architectural design decisions and sustainability requirements explicit.},

	abstract = {Many countries have founded national high performance computing center aiming to provide computational resources to their scientists upon requests. The resources provided are not efficient because the job requests are not relative to the real use leading to unnecessary resource consumption. In this paper, we present a method to monitor and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) resources more efficiently. Usually, the HPC resources are managed by a Portable Batch System (PBS) as the Job Management System (JMS) for effective job scheduling and resource allocation. However, the HPC resources often engage in inefficient job requests. For instance, a job request may have for four processors running per node for two hours, but the actual usage engages four processors per node for one hour. Hence, the HPC resources lose an hour of productivity. As a consequence, the queues for job execution are longer. The automated job monitoring system proposed in this paper would scan all the jobs on every HPC Node and compare the job requests conditions with preset criteria. If the conditions meet the criteria, then the inefficient jobs are forced to cancel from the HPC queue. The results show that more HPC resources are available for executing other jobs in the queue, leading to saved resources in the HPC environment and Stabilization of HPC hardware, promoting an HPC infrastructure ecosystem.},

However, the expansion of course platforms and the scarcity of student data increases the difficulty in finding courses, or even part of courses, that fill a given knowledge gap. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system to support students in finding the best modules or courses in these ecosystems. First, topic modeling techniques were implemented with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to find similarities between multiple MOOCs providers. Then, a content-based recommendation provides recommendations to a user interested in acquiring new knowledge, based on a history extraction on those platforms. We evaluate our approach through an experiment with real data collected in multiple MOOCs providers. In addition, by comparing the NMF approach with a baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique, we verify the model effectiveness and show that our system is useful to this context.},

They often use so-called "Workplace Travel Plans" as policy interventions to engage work organizations as active players, promoting sustainable commuting amongst their employees. However, it remains difficult to systematically engage work organizations and commuters in such efforts for a number of reasons, ranging from preferences to constraints that they have to deal with. We aim at providing commuters, work organizations, and public administrators with tools that facilitate this engagement. In this paper, we discuss the requirements for the design of technology supporting corresponding services for commuters and work organizations. We also outline the comparative work we are aiming to do to understand how Western requirement differ from countries like India.},

	abstract = {In recent years, China's economy has developed rapidly, but at the same time, the ecological environment has also been damaged to a certain extent. Therefore, in the context of sustainable development strategy, how to improve economic development, at the same time, to protect the ecological environment construction is one of the important issues. At present, there is no substantial breakthrough in this field in China. Therefore, this paper proposes a simulation analysis of regional economic system based on composite ecosystem model. In this paper, the complex ecosystem and regional economy are deeply studied and analyzed. It is believed that the contradiction between economic development and environmental protection mainly comes from the extensive economic development strategy. In view of this situation, this paper uses system dynamics as the theoretical basis to establish a regional economic simulation model based on composite ecosystem. In this paper, the algorithm of the model is optimized and the corresponding evaluation index system is established. The model system covers 20 important variables, of which 2 are fixed value variables. In order to further verify the actual effect of the simulation model, this paper takes the data of Shenzhen city from 2010 to 2019 as the experimental simulation object, and carries out a number of experiments including the establishment of comprehensive evaluation index of economy and ecosystem, coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of economy and ecosystem. The data shows that Shenzhen's economic system is increasing year by year from 0.261 in 2010 to 0.789 in 2019.},

	abstract = {As machine learning is applied more widely, data scientists often struggle to find or create end-to-end machine learning systems for specific tasks. The proliferation of libraries and frameworks and the complexity of the tasks have led to the emergence of "pipeline jungles" - brittle, ad hoc ML systems. To address these problems, we introduce the Machine Learning Bazaar, a new framework for developing machine learning and automated machine learning software systems. First, we introduce ML primitives, a unified API and specification for data processing and ML components from different software libraries. Next, we compose primitives into usable ML pipelines, abstracting away glue code, data flow, and data storage. We further pair these pipelines with a hierarchy of AutoML strategies - Bayesian optimization and bandit learning. We use these components to create a general-purpose, multi-task, end-to-end AutoML system that provides solutions to a variety of data modalities (image, text, graph, tabular, relational, etc.) and problem types (classification, regression, anomaly detection, graph matching, etc.). We demonstrate 5 real-world use cases and 2 case studies of our approach. Finally, we present an evaluation suite of 456 real-world ML tasks and describe the characteristics of 2.5 million pipelines searched over this task suite.},

	abstract = {Over the years, pervasive computing and communication technologies have enabled the emergence of new computing paradigms that have gained importance across a wide spectrum of domains. The three most notable that have witnessed significant advancements and have a solid track record of exponential growth in diverse applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Mobile Computing. The ubiquity of these paradigms, their expandability, and applicability in different problem spaces have made them invaluable in modern computing solutions. Security becomes a real concern, especially when it comes to the development of applications in these environments, as numerous security issues may arise from potential design flaws. Secure application development across these three technologies can only be achieved when applications and systems are designed and developed with security in mind. This will improve the quality of the solutions and ensure that vulnerabilities are identified. It will also help in defining countermeasures against cyberattacks or mitigate the effects of potential threats to the systems. This article surveys existing approaches, tools, and techniques for attack and system modeling applicable to IoT, Cloud computing, and Mobile Computing. It also evaluates the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and tools, from which it highlights the main existing challenges and open issues in the area.},

Though large code models significantly outperform their smaller counterparts, around 70% of displayed code completions from Copilot are not accepted by developers. Being reviewed but not accepted, their help to developer productivity is considerably limited. Even worse, considering the high cost of the large code models, it is a huge waste of computing resources and energy. To fill this significant gap, we propose an early-rejection mechanism to turn down low-return prompts by foretelling the code completion qualities without sending them to the code completion system. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight Transformer-based estimator to demonstrate the feasibility of the mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed estimator helps save 23.3% of computational cost measured in floating-point operations for the code completion systems, and 80.2% of rejected prompts lead to unhelpful completion.},

However, the evaluation of RS has traditionally focused on satisfying the needs of end users, item providers, or the recommendation platform itself without considering the impact on society. Sustainable tourism practices are becoming increasingly important, and a Tourism Recommendation System (TRS) can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability by suggesting sustainable activities and less popular destinations to users. In this study, we explore the effect of integrating sustainable recommendations into TRS to ensure fairness for society. We conduct a user study utilizing synthetic recommendations to assess user perceptions of sustainable options versus unsustainable options. Our contributions include insights into effective strategies for incorporating sustainable items in recommendations, understanding user reactions to sustainable alternatives, and identifying helpful recommendation elements for users in their decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that including sustainable options in recommendations can encourage tourists to visit sustainable and less popular areas and help address issues such as overtourism and undertourism in the travel and tourism industry.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion of data volumes from a myriad of distributed sources such as ubiquitous cameras and various sensors. The challenges of analyzing these geographically dispersed datasets are increasing due to the significant data movement overhead, time-consuming data aggregation, and escalating energy needs. Rather than constantly move a tremendous amount of raw data to remote warehouse-scale computing systems for processing, it would be beneficial to leverage in-situ server systems (InS) to pre-process data, i.e., bringing computation to where the data is located.This paper takes the first step towards designing server clusters for data processing in the field. We investigate two representative in-situ computing applications, where data is normally generated from environmentally sensitive areas or remote places that lack established utility infrastructure. These very special operating environments of in-situ servers urge us to explore standalone (i.e., off-grid) systems that offer the opportunity to benefit from local, self-generated energy sources. In this work we implement a heavily instrumented proof-of-concept prototype called InSURE: in-situ server systems using renewable energy. We develop a novel energy buffering mechanism and a unique joint spatio-temporal power management strategy to coordinate standalone power supplies and in-situ servers. We present detailed deployment experiences to quantify how our design fits with in-situ processing in the real world. Overall, InSURE yields 20%~60% improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline. It maintains impressive control effectiveness in under-provisioned environment and can economically scale along with the data processing needs. The proposed design is well complementary to today's grid-connected cloud data centers and provides competitive cost-effectiveness.},

The recognition of sustainability has faced dramatic alterations with new aspects in recent decades, various methodologies, tools, organizations, and initiatives emerged in order to catch the change and take steps toward a sustainable future. However, the world-wide pervasive environmental degradation and rising social equity problems reveal clearly that these efforts lack the sufficient power to stimulate the social, economic, and political commitment.This study proposes a methodological tool for constructing a network which provides coordination and increased strength among the agents of sustainable development.

This research focuses on two grassroots sustainable agriculture communities, which are seeking to develop a food infrastructure that is under their own control, and thereby more resilient to disruptions across the globe. This paper presents a five-year ethnographic study of these two communities, maps out the values of members of these communities, and explores the implications of their values on the information systems that members use and that could be developed to support them in the future. By doing so, we hope to influence the design of future information systems to align more closely with the values of these stakeholders, and through these stakeholders to move toward a food system that supports food security and global sustainability.},

	abstract = {There is significant interest in designing technologies for the food system, from agricultural modeling tools to apps enabling humans to assess nutritional value of various food choices to drones for pest detection. However, a good food system must be a sustainable one. There is an urgent need for deliberation and thoughtfulness in designing for both technologies that support existing food systems and new modalities that work towards more sustainable food systems. This workshop will bring together HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners with an interest in exploring what constitutes a sustainable food system, as well as defining the role of HCI in this domain. Our key objectives for this workshop will be to identify what opportunities for design and collaboration exist and to lay the foundation for an active foodCHI community.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the term sustainability gains more and more importance in corporate risk management and decision making. Corporate Sustainability Information Systems should support companies to analyse sustainability risks and provide relevant data in a practical manner. A major challenge in the domain of sustainability is to integrate environmental, social and economic data from different sources. This paper presents an approach for ontology-based data integration in the Corporate Sustainability domain preserving hierarchical relations to allow e.g. improved querying. Based on an existing sustainability framework defined in an XBRL-taxonomy, first a mechanism for the automatic generation of a domain-specific ontology is proposed. Finally, special data is queried and linked to the proposed ontology, serving as a working example for the suggested approach.},

	abstract = {As an essential part of modern power delivery networks, on-chip voltage regulation consisting of multiple distributed voltage regulators provides the required power and voltage levels for localized load circuits. The harsh application environment of internet of things (IoT) and heterogeneous computing systems including, but not limited to, high temperature and large load current variations, can lead to significant and uneven performance degradations of on-chip voltage regulators due to aging. Investigating sustainable on-chip voltage regulation schemes considering the lifetime of different distributed voltage regulators becomes imperative. Furthermore, techniques to mitigate the aging induced voltage regulator degradations can consume the scarce on-chip area resource. In this work, a new reliable on-chip voltage regulation technique is explored to simultaneously mitigate the performance degradation and reduce the area cost of distributed on-chip voltage regulators to achieve sustainable and compact design and satisfy the needs of different IoT and heterogeneous computing systems considering the interactions among different regulators. A brief survey of reliable design challenges and potential solutions is also provided.},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have become a main technology driver for our intelligent society. However, almost all cyber-physical systems rely on battery-powered devices to function, which suffer from high maintenance cost for recharging/replacing the batteries and bring in negative environmental impacts due to the hazardous chemicals used in the batteries. To address this challenge, a new computing paradigm called intermittent computing (IC) was proposed which advocates a battery-free design where cyber-physical devices can be completely powered by energy scavenged from ambient sources such as sunlight, radio waves, and vibrations. Since its advent, many efforts have been made on addressing the challenges in IC, from the hardware to the software stack. In this vision paper, we make a brief summary of existing works on IC and discuss a more realistic setup where, instead of focusing on one IC node as done in most existing works, we propose to build a self-sustainable cyber-physical system through the collaboration of distributed IC devices---collaborative intermittent computing (CIC). We discuss the challenges in CIC and provide a vision for the future cyber-physical systems.},

We analyse the processes by which solutions are collaboratively designed by citizens who are playing the roles of potential inhabitants, focussing on the analysis of argumentative interactions. Results show that the RPS stimulates debate about sociotechnical solutions, rules and rational criteria, in addition to sustainability values and ideological criteria. The RPS is thus a means for making sociotechnical solutions evolve and for identifying what is "technically", "socially" and "ideologically" necessary for acceptance and success of the future system.},

	abstract = {Investment in sustainability strategies and technologies holds promise for significant cost savings over the operational phase of a facility's life cycle, while more effectively meeting stakeholder needs. However, accurately estimating the first costs of a green project during the early concept development stages is challenging, and effective ways to comprehensively predict potential lifecycle cost impacts of sustainability strategies do not exist. This paper describes a agent-based model (ABM) of the Total Cost of Ownership of green facilities applicable at the earliest stages of concept development. An ABM approach captures the social, environmental, and engineering systems that characterize a facility's life cycle cost. It permits evaluating the impact of the institutional and industry environment on facility life cycle performance, and also captures the cost impacts of tightly coupled facility systems that characterize green design.},

	abstract = {Sustainable HCI was initially structured along two axes: sustainability in design, i.e. reducing the material impact of software and hardware, and sustainability through design, i.e. influencing user behavior to reduce energy consumption. These approaches have been criticized for being reductive and insufficient in the face of the systemic problem of ecological transition. Some voices in the HCI community call for a broader consideration of non-human aspects in HCI and argue that new methods and tools should be developed for this purpose. The thesis aims at proposing a methodology to understand the interactions between the system to be designed (e.g. agricultural robot) and the dynamics of the socio-technical and social system (e.g. the agriculture and food sectors), in order to avoid simplistic solutions that could be counter-productive (e.g. rebound effect). It draws on the methods, tools, and techniques of systemic design (a recent field of research that brings together design and systems thinking) in order to build, with the stakeholders and the help of experts, a model of the socio-technical system, its dynamics, and its possible interactions with the system to be designed. The aim is not to build a "digital twin" of the socio-technical system from which one could predict its evolution, but rather to co-build a handmade and approximate model to support debate, to inform decisions, and to compare scenarios. To this end, the thesis proposes a "quali-quantitative" modeling tool based on the formalism of causal loop diagrams.},

In an expert workshop with 22 stakeholders, we gathered requirements for an assistance system supporting customers in identifying the sustainability of products at the point of sale. We integrated the resulting demands in a first mockup prototype, which was tested and discussed with a focus group. From the workshop and the focus group discussion, we deduced a set of ten guidelines for sustainability-oriented assistance systems. These guidelines were transferred into a prototypical mobile application, which allows customers to specify their personal understanding of multiple dimensions of sustainability. According to this profile, they receive easily understandable ratings for scanned products while shopping. A user study in a real supermarket strengthens the deduced guidelines and indicates that such a system can support customers to make more sustainable product choices.},

We demonstrate that structuring a professional development program around these principles facilitates the development of important strategies such as the identification of salient system variables, effectively distributing expertise, and constructing curricular adaptations. We discuss two meta-level themes that may account for the success of the principles: attending to structure vs. agency and setting short-term vs. long-term goals. Each illustrates the tension existing between competing variables that need to be considered to effectively program for professional development around educational technology with the goal of sustaining and scaling innovations in real world complex educational systems.},

In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both performance metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.},

	abstract = {Nowadays we experience a paradigm shift in our society, where every item around us is becoming a computer facilitating life-changing applications like self-driving cars, tele-medicine, precision agriculture or virtual reality. On one hand, for the execution of such resource demanding applications we need powerful IT facilities. On the other hand, the requirements often include latencies below 100 ms or even below 10 ms -- what is called ''tactile internet''. To facilitate low latency computation has to be placed in the vicinity of the end users by utilizing the concept of Edge Computing. In this talk we explain the challenges of Edge systems in combination with tactile internet. We discuss the recent problems of geographically distributed machine learning applications and novel approaches to balance competing priorities like the energy efficiency and the staleness of the machine learning models. Available failure resilience mechanisms designed for Cloud computing or generic distributed systems cannot be applied to Edge systems due to timeliness, hyper heterogeneity and resource scarcity. Therefore, we discuss a novel machine learning based mechanism that evaluates the failure resilience of a service deployed redundantly on the edge infrastructure. Our approach learns the spatiotemporal dependencies between edge server failures and combines them with the topological information to incorporate link failures by utilizing the concept of the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Eventually, we infer the probability that a certain set of servers fails or disconnects concurrently during service runtime.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of the small cloud (SC), both in concept and in practice, has been driven mainly by issues related to service cost and complexity of commercial cloud providers (e.g., Amazon) employing massive data centers. However, the resource inelasticity problem [29] faced by the SCs due to their relatively scarce resources might lead to a potential degradation of customer QoS and loss of revenue. A proposed solution to this problem recommends the sharing of resources between competing SCs to alleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise. Based on this idea, a recent e?ort ([18]) proposed SC-Share, a performance-driven static market model for competitive small cloud environments that results in an e?cient market equilibrium jointly optimizing customer QoS satisfaction and SC revenue generation. However, an important question with a non-obvious answer still remains to be answered, without which SC sharing markets may not be guaranteed to sustain in the long-run - is it still possible to achieve a stable market e?cient state when the supply of SC resources is dynamic in nature?. In this paper, we take a? rst step to addressing the problem of e?cient market design for single SC resource sharing in dynamic environments. We answer our previous question in the a?rmative through the use of Arrow and Hurwicz's disequilibrium process [9, 10] in economics, and the gradient play technique in game theory that allows us to iteratively converge upon e?cient and stable market equilibria.},

User research found recipes to be a reflective and creative space for imagining "what we should eat". Through simple website technologies we redesign the recipe to afford users the opportunity of exploring "what we should eat" within the context of the wider agro-food system. The site provides a digital space for dialogic interactions between farmers, backyard growers, shoppers and foragers to "rewrite" the recipe to include information about the origins of a single ingredient. In connecting the labour of the field with the labour of the home and kitchen, this tool deliberately breaks down the false dichotomy of producer and consumer, and identifies all users as active producers within the food system, albeit within different contexts.},

Ensuring fairness in TRS involves considering the needs and viewpoints of different stakeholders, including consumers, item providers, the platform, and society. Although previous research has focused on fairness in TRS from a multistakeholder perspective, little attention has been given to generating sustainable recommendations. This doctoral thesis introduces the concept of Societal Fairness (S-Fairness) to consider the impact of tourism on non-participating stakeholders (society) such as residents, who may be affected by tourism issues such as increased housing prices, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion. The objective of this research is to contribute to the field of TRS by (1) modeling sustainability for societal fairness, (2) developing a fair multistakeholder TRS that balances sustainability concerns with other stakeholders while minimizing trade-offs, and (3) evaluating the approach through user studies and offline dataset evaluation to ensure user acceptance of recommendations.},

	abstract = {The notion of establishing energy communities where householders collectively participate in using renewable energy is highly topical. In this paper, we interrogate a design vision of sustainable communal energy developed through a techno-solutionist narrative. The vision is exemplified in a recommendation-based mobile app, the Community Energy Planner app, that provides individual and collective energy feedback on renewable energy actions. To obtain insights into how householders understand and experience embedding such recommended communal energy feedback into domestic energy-consuming practices, we deployed the app with six households for one month. Through a qualitative study, we report on householders' experiences living with the app on an individual and at a community level. Our findings are presented in four themes, revealing that recommended feedback on individual and collective energy actions is challenging to align with the messiness of domestic life. Finally, we discuss alternative design visions for sustainable communal energy. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) a field deployment study of a techno-solutionist narrative of communal energy facilitated through an app and, 2) a discussion on alternatives to this design vision.},

Early equipment planning decisions have direct implications on schedules, costs, and more importantly, the environmental performance of such operations. While traditional planning of earthmoving works is ad-hoc and based on planners' experiences, ensuring favorable performance requires advanced analytical techniques that consider multiple variables and competing objectives. Accordingly, this study develops a discrete-event simulation-based decision-support system (DES-DSS) for selecting the optimal equipment fleet, while considering the trade-offs between time, cost, and environmental impacts. The model's results from a case study reveal how different fleet mixes and sizes can considerably impact associated emissions, durations, and costs. The DES-DSS can aid planners in making informed decisions during early planning stages and be used as a control feedback mechanism to continuously enhance operations in real-time while reducing emissions.},

	abstract = {Cloud platforms' growing energy demand and carbon emissions are raising concern about their environmental sustainability. The current approach to enabling sustainable clouds focuses on improving energy-efficiency and purchasing carbon offsets. These approaches have limits: many cloud data centers already operate near peak efficiency, and carbon offsets cannot scale to near zero carbon where there is little carbon left to offset. Instead, enabling sustainable clouds will require applications to adapt to when and where unreliable low-carbon energy is available. Applications cannot do this today because their energy use and carbon emissions are not visible to them, as the energy system provides the rigid abstraction of a continuous, reliable energy supply. This vision paper instead advocates for a "carbon first" approach to cloud design that elevates carbon-efficiency to a firs--class metric. To do so, we argue that cloud platforms should virtualize the energy system by exposing visibility into, and software-defined control of, it to applications, enabling them to define their own abstractions for managing energy and carbon emissions based on their own requirements.},

	abstract = {Background: The software engineering community has increasingly conducted systematic literature reviews (SLR) as a means to summarize evidence from different studies and bring to light the state of the art of a given research topic. While SLR provide many benefits, they also present several problems with punctual solutions for some of them. However, two main problems still remain: the high time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective impact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. Aims: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new view --- which we name Sustainability of SLR --- on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing those problems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in the last decade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and their interconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of Sustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: The proposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and technical) that could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the four major problems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those problems) that we identified could be mitigated. Conclusions: The view of Sustainability of SLR intends to change the researchers' mindset to mitigate the inherent SLR problems and, as a consequence, achieve sustainable SLR, i.e., those that consume less time/effort to be conducted and updated with useful results for the industry.},

Despite high user satisfaction with the system and interface, and extensive user feedback and analysis, many users experienced difficulties in signing on and use, ranging from simple lack of resources to complex organizational and intellectual trade-offs.

In this paper, we present our experiences of introducing and playing systems thinking games, how the systems thinking exercise sessions were conducted, outcomes of the sessions and finally some lessons learnt.

In this paper, we describe our experiences deploying more than 5,000 Solar Home Systems in Ethiopia and the sustain-ability problems we faced. Towards developing a decentralized and sustainable solar solution, we have designed SIMbaLink, an extremely low-cost real-time solar monitoring system that significantly reduces both the maintenance costs and the time to repair. By explicitly exposing the real-time status of a solar system to all parties concerned, SIMbaLink addresses the lack of accountability and trust concerns. SIMbaLink can be easily integrated with existing solar systems and can reduce equipment failure rates through early detection of system malfunctions.},

Effective procurement is tied with efficient and highly accurate collection of data needed for purchasing the right material with the acceptable quality from appropriate suppliers. Supply chain management (SCM) consists of complex networks of distributed actors in which the problem of identifying the appropriate suppliers and allocating optimal order quantities based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) attributes is strategically important. However, implementation of an autonomous and automated assessment that can incorporate dynamics and uncertainty of the whole supply chain during the assessment period is not addressed. In the current research paper, a novel framework is designed and proposed to narrow the aforementioned gap. Agent technology has been incorporated in the developed framework to decrease the supplier chain uncertainty by decreasing human interactions and automating the process of supplier evaluation and order allocation.},

Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look specifically at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identified 535 papers, of which 60 were identified as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.},

	abstract = {The term Smart Sustainable City (SSC) has been gaining popularity due to the growth of initiatives to address urban problems towards sustainable development. SSC can be considered as a combination of sustainable city and smart city, and some variance between the concepts may be expected. As this is a modern term, the literature falls short of studies presenting factors that hinder and/or facilitate the complex phenomenon of SSC development. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse scientific studies to identify aspects that influence the progress of smart sustainable cities. The methodological approach undertaken was a systematic literature review that included 169 papers. The results offer a comprehensive list of 57 drivers and 63 barriers, classified according to five main dimensions of a smart sustainable city, which are the three sustainability pillars (society, environment, and economy), combined to governance, and urban infrastructure. The findings revealed `governance' as the most significant domain for SSC development, and multistakeholder engagement as one of the main challenges. This study shows that SSC is not a research field itself, but an interdisciplinary concept, contributing to academics, government, and policymakers for eradicating potential interferences in the development of smart and sustainable cities.},

	abstract = {Advances in Device-to-Device (D2D) ecosystems have brought on mobile applications that utilise nearby mobile devices in order to improve users' quality of experience (QoE). The interactions between the mobile devices have to be transparent to the end users and can be of many services -- opportunistic networking, traffic offloading, computation offloading, cooperative streaming and P2P based k-anonymity location privacy service, to name a few. Whenever mobile users are willing to "ask for help" from their neighbours, they need to make non trivial decisions in order to maximise their utility. Current motivation approaches for mobile users that participate in such environments are of two types: (i) credit-based and (ii) reputation-based. These approaches rely either on centralised authorities or require prohibitively many messages or require tamper resistant security modules. In this paper we propose a trust-based approach that does not require synchronisation between the mobile users. Moreover, we present the three-way tradeoff between, consistency, message exchange and awareness and we conclude that our approach can provide first-rate data to neighbour selection mechanisms for D2D ecosystems with much less overhead.},

The approach of software system development is called Federated Embedded Systems (FES) and their revolved ecosystem of players is presented, aiming to ensure quality in engineering SoS. Ecosystems for Federated Embedded Systems (EcoFES) comprise a new area of research that scales component-based software development for embedded software into new dimensions. The proposed ecosystem dimension introduces an open, flexible and adaptable SoS architecture for improving the process of FES development. In the paper, we identify some architectural challenges and discuss the implications of scaling from a closed ecosystem to an open one, providing open collaboration and innovation in the context of FES.},

	abstract = {∗The world is facing greater challenges in eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and all forms of malnutrition. Political conflict, economic slowdown, climate changes, and a pandemic are apparently becoming threats to progress. As one of the externalities of a food system, public policy like social protection programs, encompassed a range of regulations and programs used for problem-solving and holds a determinant role in the long term application of food systems. However, the food system is a complex web of activities that involve all fundamental aspects of social, environmental, and economic to achieve the state of the equilibrium system. The negative outcomes towards the environment are unavoidable since 26% of global emissions is coming from food production, processing, and distribution. The impact assessment of social protection policies towards the environment remains limited. This paper investigates the environmental impacts of three social protection programs: cash transfer, food subsidy, and in-kind transfer; using a system dynamics approach. The conceptual model provides a deep-structural insight and understanding of the ideas on how social protection programs in the food and agricultural system strongly influence the outturn of the environmental impacts. The developed model has shown the interlinkages of household expenditure increment, which influences by income level and social protection access that caused more dynamics and uncertain behavior in food consumption level. This considered as more impactful for environment sustainability since it will cause more production and distribution activities which drawn more greenhouse gas and food loss. Three external factors are determined as the control variables: price settings policy, import policy, and the amount of regional supply.},

Especially cyber-physical systems should benefit by this progress to provide smart applications in ambient environments of private and industrial space. But a proper and methodical engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems (CPES) is still an open and important issue. Traditional software and systems engineering facilities (system models, description languages, or process models) do not consider fundamental characteristics of these ecosystems as openness, uncertainty, or emergent constitution at runtime sufficiently. But especially these aspects let blur the line of system boundaries at design time. The diverse components of CPES have essential impacts on the engineering of CPES as well, concerning time synchronizing, execution control, and interaction structure. Self-balanced control in CPES promises new application possibilities, but also needs new engineering techniques concerning the overall engineering process, including requirements engineering and runtime verification. In this position paper we survey and summarize the dimensions of challenges in applying control theory for the engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems.},

Developing Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) should eventually support knowledge sharing and learning at collective level. When analyzing and planning information systems, two roles of KOS need to be considered: knowledge maturing and interoperability. Knowledge Maturing can be described as goal-oriented learning on a collective level. Interoperability is defined as enabler which leads to knowledge flow, cooperation and eventually to a reduction of transaction costs. In line with the knowledge maturing model, we assume that stabilizing and dynamic forces co-exist in all organizations which seek a dynamic equilibrium between further development and stabilization. We assume that identifying and measuring these forces will help in the effective development of KOS and consequently support planning and development of information systems. We suggest ways of measuring these forces as existing and anticipated connectivity between nodes in Digital Business Ecosystems.},

This paper explores how to support energy as a first-class operating system resource. Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.},

The emerging capabilities of intelligent learning systems highlight and exacerbate existing challenges with meaningful human control of, and accountability for, the actions and effects of such systems. The related challenge of human `answerability' for system actions and harms has come into focus in recent literature on responsibility gaps [2, 3]. We describe a proposed interdisciplinary approach to designing for answerability in autonomous systems, grounded in an instrumentalist framework of `responsible agency cultivation' drawn from moral philosophy and cognitive sciences as well as empirical results from structured interviews and focus groups in the application domains of health, finance and government. We outline a prototype dialogue agent informed by these emerging results and designed to help bridge the structural gaps in organisations that typically impede the human agents responsible for an autonomous sociotechnical system from answering to vulnerable patients of responsibility.},

Powering the system directly from the energy harvesting source can mitigate this problem, but requires system software support to handle computations across power cycles, a paradigm known as transiently powered computing. We have designed portable system techniques to enable checkpointing of the program state on stable storage, along with its later recovery, with minimal latency and energy consumption [1]. Right now, we are investigating how to determine where and when to perform checkpointing, and what support do we need to offer to developers to manage developing applications that may be interrupted for a non-negligible amount of time and later resume.},

Using ACT we demonstrate optimizing hardware for carbon yields distinct solutions compared to optimizing for performance and efficiency.

	abstract = {Survey-based indoor positioning systems are expensive to establish and maintain. We describe how a crowdsourced WiFi radio map building problem can be framed as a trajectory alignment problem and further solved by the existing graph-based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) framework. Specifically, we show how to exploit crowd-sourced WiFi signals and construct opportunistic constraints that satisfy the WiFi signal consistency modelled by Gaussian Processes (GP). We repurpose GraphSLAM to optimise these WiFi constraints collectively to approximate an optimised global signal consistency. We implement an automatic pipeline we call GPSLAM to produce radio maps based only on crowdsourced mobile data. Evaluation based on realistically crowdsourced mobile data generated naturally and passively by common visitors of multiple shopping malls demonstrates that GPSLAM can build radio maps that achieve comparable results to laborious manual surveys while the human intervention involved is minimised.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development and application of a non-human animal persona in designing to support co-operative and free-range animal agriculture. This work is grounded in case study research of a small free-range egg farm, through which field and interview work were undertaken. We demonstrate how existing user-centred design tools, such as the persona, can be used to better reflect co-operative farming philosophies and more meaningfully represent both farmer and animal stakeholders within the design process. This approach is theoretically orientated within sustainable HCI and Animal Computer Interaction (ACI), which is itself an extension of HCI. The species-specific persona of a chicken allows representation and ensures that the animal, which is made deliberately invisible within factory and intensive farming, is made visible through and within the design of an online system. By making explicit the implicit assumptions we hold about an animal, such personas provide a tool for thinking, design, and further discussion.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to identify issues that arise when software systems from different ecosystems are composed into a system of systems. Whether it is an explicit, managed ecosystem or the implicit ecosystem of collaborators, competitors, and users that surrounds any organization, the community of organizations has momentum in a particular direction. When a system of systems is composed using systems from each of several ecosystems the differences in communities can prevent satisfactory integration. We examine the case of a portion of the infrastructure needed to support automated driving. We use Maier's criteria that identify challenges for systems of systems as starting points for investigations into differences among ecosystems. We found points of commonality that tie together the ecosystems include use of common standards, membership by large organizations in multiple ecosystems, and influences of the outside business environment. We also found points of variation including whether the systems have compatible real-time expectations, terms of licenses, frequency of new releases, and architectural assumptions. Developers of a system of systems benefit from being aware of the similarities and differences among the ecosystems from which their systems originate because both the similarities and differences help developers anticipate the evolutionary trajectories of the individual systems.},

Moreover, the variety of available methods and software tools makes it challenging for non-experts to identify the most appropriate analysis option. This research aims to assist non-experts in selecting the most appropriate set of analysis methods and software tools prior to conducting sustainable engineering analysis (SEA) based on life cycle data accessible to them. A questionnaire-based ranking methodology is developed for non-experts, which reduces their time investment in examining the myriad SEA methods and tools and avoids non-value added effort. The questionnaire uses an interaction matrix within a general mathematical modeling approach to map a given set of methods and tools to user responses. Relevance weights are integrated within the matrix to rank available environmental, economic, and social assessment methods and tools for user consideration. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, a pilot project was conducted to improve the design of a hexacopter. Results were compared using lower- and higher-fidelity software tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the relevance weights assigned to each tool. Assigned weights were determined to enable differentiation between low and high fidelity methods and tools, but as new methods and tools enter into use, these weights must be updated. The process of selecting SEA methods and software gives insight into the utility of the interaction matrix implemented within the tool developed in this research. Moreover, non-experts can compare various design alternatives using the selected analysis methods and software tools to arrive at a solution with improved sustainability performance.}

abstract = {Context:
Decision making pervades software and systems engineering. Intertemporal decisions involve trade-offs among outcomes at different points in time. They play a central role in systems design, as recognised since the inception of the software engineering (SE) field. They are also crucial for the sustainability of design decisions. However, temporal decision making is not adequately understood in SE. The field of Judgement and Decision Making (JDM) offers important empirical findings and research methods that could be utilised.
Objective:
This article establishes a baseline for studying how software professionals handle intertemporal choices. It examines how temporal distance affects choices in an example scenario, explores in what areas of software development such decisions can be found, and examines how systems design decisions can be characterised and studied as intertemporal.
Method:
We developed a method to study intertemporal choice in SE, based on an initial set of psychological theory grounded in JDM. We instantiated the method in a study to elicit responses to an intertemporal choice task followed by a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) interview.
Results:
We found that study participants overall tended to discount future outcomes, but individual participants varied wildly in how they valued present vs. future outcomes. They indicated several locations in which intertemporal choices occur in everyday software development. Based on these findings, and by reconciling our initial theory with existing JDM theory and results, we further developed and refined our theory and study method into a framework for studying intertemporal decision making in SE.
Conclusions:
To obtain a basis for more sustainable software systems design decisions, SE research should adopt a more comprehensive, detailed, and empirically consistent way of understanding and studying intertemporal choices. We provide suggestions for how future research could achieve practical methods that address essential characteristics of real-life systems design decisions.}

abstract = {This paper presents a Microsoft Excel tool to calculate liquid-gas mass transfer coefficients in packed towers to support numerical design activities in the courses of Unit Operations for Industrial Process and Sustainable Process Design for the Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering of the University of Naples Federico II (Italy). The Mass Transfer Solver Tool (MT Solver Tool) uses several available models to estimate, separately, the values of liquid and gas mass-transfer coefficients and the wet surface area for 144 random and structured packings of interest for absorption/stripping and distillation processes. In addition, a separate spreadsheet can be used in a user-defined mode, to evaluate the mass transfer coefficients with new packing types or to interpret experimental data when the geometrical and physical characteristics of the packing are known. Eventually, the tool is supplied with a data library, where packing geometry and model fitting parameters can be retrieved. The software is aimed to support students and educators in the Unit Operations for Industrial Process and Sustainable Process Design courses. In particular, this is meant to be an example on how the accuracy of design algorithms adopted in unit operation processes is affected by the use of the underpinning correlations for mass transfer rate or pressure drops. Besides, this is aimed to encourage comparison of different correlations when exact field data are not available. Besides, chemical engineers and researchers interested in packed columns design and modelling data may also benefit from the utilization of the software. The MT Solver Tool was introduced to students in a dedicated tutorial lesson after lecturers on packed column design algorithms for distillation, absorption and stripping. Most of the students of the course participated to a group training aimed to simulate the design of an absorption column supported by the MT Solver Tool providing feedback on its application. After the training, an anonymous survey was proposed to the students to monitor the approval rating of the proposed activity and the use of the MT Solver Tool software to support numerical calculations.}

In this work, in study class consisting in students of the Logistic and Transport Engineering program, it is developed and implemented a realistic problem situation: a sales e-commerce company has to decide, by analyzing received orders, whether to implement its own delivery system or hire a third-party delivery company. The software GeOrder Simulator is employed to generate random data for weight and location of simulated orders and the data are presented to students in tabular and iconic, onto a map geolocation, semiotic representation registers. The research aim of this work, is to analyze, from the perspective of Semiotic Representation Theory, the effect onto the statistical reasoning that is provoked in students when they solve the realistic problem situation with the data generated by the GeOrder Simulator. The results show that the addressing of the realistic problem situation together with the usage of the GeOrder Simulator, elicited the statistical reasoning in the students since it is observed the integration of statistical concepts within their argumentation, by means of the coordination of tabular, graphical and numerical semiotic representation registers.}

Although many policies in China have been issued to promote construction waste management, unfortunately there is no significant effect, and the key is lack of a quantitative evaluation system and guidance on management level. Based on the domestic and foreign relevant experiences, this paper puts forward a new system to evaluate waste management performance in an architectural engineering project. Through research, main influence factors of construction waste management in our country are confirmed, namely: “commitment of contractor's representative on site; collecting packed materials back by suppliers; minimizing rework in the construction phase; design and construction using standardized materials; and appointment of laborers solely for waste disposal”. Through four construction cases in the Pearl River Delta with the application of performance assessment model of waste management in architectural engineering projects, it is proved that the model can effectively measure the waste management performance in construction site, with clearer responsibilities and higher performance. Finally, it is suggested that our government should assess waste management performance in construction site pertinently, develop market assessment software actively, and promote the environmental sustainable development of architectural industry.}

Integrating multi-disciplinary sustainability concepts into the higher education of computer scientists is important in that this ensures that future ICT endeavours will take sustainability concerns into account. This article describes four capstone projects developed by students from the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Pervasive Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM), who were enrolled alongside regular students in a traditional software engineering course held at the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The coursework was part of a research project called Green.Citizen@ICT, which aims at investigating the use of ICT and software services for infusing sustainable habits in citizens through the development of applications for SD. This study demonstrates how a sustainable development focus can be integrated into a traditional software engineering course. The goal of this article is to enhance understanding of the integration of sustainability into software engineering education, by providing a detailed example of a master course in which this took place. This course supported the development of ICT competences for building cleaner, greener, and more resource- and energy-efficient cyber-physical systems, while addressing the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.}

Bone remodelling models that consider strain adaptation, both with and without piezoelectric effects, were simulated and validated in this study. This simulation help to better comprehend the interplay between mechanical and electrical stimulations during these processes. This study aimed to optimise the modelling of piezoelectric effects in bone modelling analysis. The connection between mechanical loads applied to bones and the resulting electrical charges generated by the piezoelectric effect was examined. Furthermore, mathematical modelling and simulation techniques were employed to enhance the piezoelectric effect and promote bone tissue growth and repair. The findings from this research have substantial implications for developing novel therapies for bone-related diseases and injuries. It was observed that electrically stimulated bone surfaces increased bone deposition. In some instances of physical disability or osteoporosis, therapeutic electrical stimulation can supplement the mechanical stresses of regular exercise to prevent bone loss. Consequently, the bone remodelling method on the software platform enables easy application and repetition of finite element analysis. This study significantly benefits bone tissue/biomedical engineering, particularly in bone remodelling, healing, and repair.}

abstract = {Context
The main part of software engineering methods, tools and technologies has developed around projects as the central organisational form of software development. A project organisation depends on clear bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time. What happens when these conditions are not given? The article claims that this is the case for software product specific ecosystems. As software is increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of customisable and configurable products, software engineering as a discipline needs to take on the challenge to support software ecosystems.
Objective
The article provides a holistic understanding of the observed and reported practices as a starting point to device specific support for the development in software ecosystems.
Method
A qualitative interview study was designed based on previous long-term ethnographical inspired research.
Results
The analysis results in a set of common features of product development and evolution despite differences in size, kind of software and business models. Design is distributed and needs to be coordinated across heterogeneous design constituencies that, together with the software, build a product specific socio-technical ecosystem. The technical design has to support the deference of part of the development not only to 3rd-party developers but also to local designers tailoring the software in the use organisation. The technical interfaces that separate the work of different design constituencies are contested and need to be maintained permanently. Development takes place as cycles within cycles – overlaying development cycles with different rhythms to accommodate different evolution drivers.
Conclusion
The reported practices challenge some of the very core assumptions of traditional software engineering, but makes perfect sense, considering that the frame of reference for product development is not a project but continuous innovation across the respective ecosystem. The article provides a number of concrete points for further research.}

However, this is a complex and long-term task. In this article we combine an analysis of accountability arrangements in software engineering and a model of sustainability transformations to trace how certain dynamics are starting to make software engineering accountable for sustainability in the technological, cultural, economic and governance domains. The article discusses existing approaches for sustainable software engineering and software engineering for sustainability, traces emerging discourses that connect digitalization and sustainability, highlights new digital business models that may support sustainability and shows governance efforts to highlight “green and digital” policy problems. Yet, we argue that these are so far niche dynamics and that a sustainability transformation requires a collective and long-lasting effort to engender systemic changes. The goal should be to create varied accountability arrangements for sustainability in software engineering which is embedded in complex ways in society and economy.}

While some studies have reviewed the development in these two domains separately, they did not address the important associations between them, nor did they analyze their joint advancement over time. Therefore, this study aims to understand and quantitatively analyze the dynamic evolution of relationships between BIM and sustainability critical towards developing BIM's functionalities to satisfy the industry's growing sustainability needs. First, 523 relevant journal articles published over the last 15 years were collected. Rule-based content analysis is then conducted on these articles using text mining to retrieve and structure relevant textual data pertaining to the six defined dimensions: BIM functionalities, software, sustainability aspects, green certification systems, project phases, and stakeholders. Social network theory is then applied to map and measure the associations between the dimensions' components for analyzing the dynamic changes in their synergies over three spans. Results reveal a significant transformation in the diversity, magnitude, and expansion of associations between BIM and sustainability domains across the supply chain. Findings also highlight less explored areas that require further research and industrial attention towards achieving full use of BIM and sustainability's integrated power. This work's novelty lies in comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing these often-dismissed synergies to reveal through knowledge-based findings how BIM has progressed to address the industry's changing sustainability requirements and recommend future directions for advancing sustainable BIM practices.}

To address these concerns, during the past few years we have developed methodologies and tools for ontology-enabled traceability; that is, traceability mechanisms where requirements are connected to models of engineering entities by threading the traceability connection through one or more ontologies. In our proof-of-concept work the engineering entities were restricted to elements of system structure. But, of course, real engineering systems also have behaviors. This paper will report on research to understand the role that software patterns (e.g., model-view-controller) and mixtures of graph and tree visualization can play in the implementation of traceability mechanisms from requirements to elements of finite-state machine behavior (e.g., actions, states, transitions and guard conditions). We will present a simple lamp example.}

abstract = {The use of BIM in the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) industry is becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, interoperability with Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) remains a significant challenge in the domain. Furthermore, available applications require high expertise to correctly implement the data export, don't allow incremental database updates and are overall non-cost-effective, moreover in the case of small and medium-sized structures. At the same time, given the need to invest in a more sustainable built environment, it is necessary to consider the whole lifecycle of constructions, including the operation and maintenance phase, while designing. In the framework of this scenario, the paper presents a research work which defines a method to implement interoperability between BIM and CMMS software by using the IFC open standard, to allow an easier management of buildings, from design to decommissioning. This method, devised to be as feasible as possible, combines an operational procedure and a practical tool. The work was supported by the software house Prometeo Srl and the Facility Management company GEMMO SpA. The method was developed based on the Feltre Hospital (Italy) and results, that were technically validated through an ad hoc BIM model, can be used by other practitioners to further implement the method in other research.}

Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) applications can support PLM by integrating heterogeneous knowledge from different stages throughout the product life. However, the integration of knowledge from different stages and teams can cause misunderstanding if not represented in a unified form. Furthermore, different forms of knowledge used by different software are neither machine-readable nor human-readable, which also sets obstacles to knowledge integration in KBE applications. Supply chain sustainability assessment is such a scenario that entails integrating knowledge from different sources. This paper firstly implements a sustainability assessment method from other scholar to calculate the supply chain sustainability performance and adapts a sustainability assessment ontology for supply chain sustainability assessment. Then, an example KBE application is developed by implementing the sustainability assessment ontology and calculation method to simulate the knowledge sharing and integration between different teams. Finally, through this example application, it is discussed that the implementation of ontology to represent knowledge in PLM application for collaborative tasks like sustainability assessment can increase the efficiency of data sharing and integration. This paper is a proof of concept for the ontology-based framework. This framework can facilitate to represent knowledge but not create new knowledge, which means it can increase the efficiency of the software development, but cannot provide a better calculation method and assessment framework for supply chain sustainability assessment.}

Simplified fatigue and fracture mechanics based assessment methods are widely used by the industry to determine the structural integrity significance of evaluate cracks, manufacturing flaws, service-induced cracking or suspected degradation of engineering components under normal and abnormal service loads. In many cases, welded joints are the areas to contain the fabrication defects or cracks initiating and growing during service operation. The welded joints are a major component that is often the cause for structure failure or for being the point at which fatigue or fracture problems initiate and propagate.

abstract = {Context
Software producing organizations have the ability to address the energy impact of their software products through their source code and software architecture. In spite of that, the focus often remains on hardware aspects, which limits the contribution of software towards energy efficient ICT solutions.
Objective
No methods exist to provide software architects information about the energy consumption of the different components in their software product. The objective of this paper is to bring software producing organizations in control of this qualitative aspect of their software.
Method
To achieve the objective, we developed the StEP Method to systematically investigate the effects of software units through the use of software stubs in relation to energy concerns. To evaluate the proposed method, an experiment involving three different versions of a commercial software product has been conducted. In the experiment, two versions of a software product were stubbed according to stakeholder concerns and stressed according to a test case, whilst energy consumption measurements were performed. The method provided guidance for the experiment and all activities were documented for future purposes.
Results
Comparing energy consumption differences across versions unraveled the energy consumption related to the products’ core functionality. Using the energy profile, stakeholders could identify the major energy consuming elements and prioritize software engineering efforts to maximize impact.
Conclusions
We introduce the StEP Method and demonstrate its applicability in an industrial setting. The method identified energy hotspots and thereby improved the control stakeholders have over the sustainability of a software product. Despite promising results, several concerns are identified that require further attention to improve the method. For instance, we recommend the investigation of software operation data to determine, and possibly automatically create, stubs.}

Today, collected industrial data is often stored in arbitrary data formats without appropriate metadata describing the data content and is therefore lost for future reuse because crucial information on how to find, access and interoperate with the data is missing. Moreover, insufficiently described or missing data can lead to wrong decisions. In order to implement the FAIR principles for industrial sensor data, this article derives the major deficits and challenges of making industrial sensor data FAIR.

Software-intensive space systems can harbor defects and vulnerabilities that may enable external adversaries or malicious insiders to disrupt or disable system functions, risking mission compromise or loss. Mitigating this risk demands a sustained focus on the security and resiliency of the system architecture including software, hardware, and other components.
Objective
In this paper we offer methodical approaches for improving space system resiliency through software architecture design, system engineering, and increased software security, thereby reducing the risk of latent software defects and vulnerabilities.
Method
We conducted a systematic review of existing architectural practices, standards, security and coding practices, various threats, defects, and vulnerabilities that impact space systems from hundreds of relevant publications and interviews of subject matter experts. We expanded on the system-level body of knowledge for resiliency and identified a new software architecture framework and acquisition methodology to improve the resiliency of space systems from a software perspective with an emphasis on the early phases of the systems engineering life cycle. This methodology involves seven steps: 1) Define technical resiliency requirements, 1a) Identify standards/policy for software resiliency, 2) Develop a request for proposal (RFP)/statement of work (SOW) for resilient space systems software, 3) Define software resiliency goals for space systems, 4) Establish software resiliency quality attributes, 5) Perform architectural tradeoffs and identify risks, 6) Conduct architecture assessments as part of the procurement process, and 7) Ascertain space system software architecture resiliency metrics.
Results
Data illustrates that software vulnerabilities can lead to opportunities for malicious cyber activities, which could degrade the space mission capability for its user community. Reducing the number of vulnerabilities by improving architecture and software system engineering practices can contribute to making space systems more resilient.

Since cyber-attacks [1] are enabled by shortfalls in software, robust software engineering practices and an architectural design are foundational to resiliency, which is a quality that allows the system to take a hit to a critical component and recover in a known, bounded, and generally acceptable period of time. To achieve software resiliency for space systems, acquirers and suppliers must identify relevant factors and systems engineering practices to apply across the life cycle, in software requirements analysis, architecture development, design, implementation, verification and validation, and maintenance phases.}

abstract = {The proliferation of information technologies and the diversity of problem domains that heavily rely on software tool applications promote computer-supported cooperative work as a challenging discipline that drives the development process of contemporary and future engineering methods, standards, and tools. Consequently, a particular domain of expertise in engineering and scientific fields has emerged, demanding more advanced skills and deeper domain knowledge. The essential role of Architectural Design (AD) and Urban Planning (UP) is to enable a forward-looking approach to building/facility creation. Construction Engineering (CE) expresses its routine primarily through a transition phase that transforms ideas to sustainable urban artifacts. The CE role appears as a combination of backward and downward looking to the same process/product. All three domains are highly cooperative in the context of Environmental Engineering (EE). Currently available software tools that support the AD, UP and CE domains are far from simple. Several recent software engineering studies suggest that, instead of developing a complex “all in one solution”, the federation or orchestration of several related simple methods and tools seems promising. In this article, we discuss the basic AD, UP and CE domain-cooperation aspects and suggest an Extensible Orchestration Framework (ExOF) model that may support them. To verify the ExOF simulation and orchestration potential, we used its architectural model to orchestrate different software tools when performing the urban blocks daylight illumination simulation for different urban block morphology models. For the exact simulation, we used the normalized sun-exposition data for the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. Also presented is an illustration of the methodology, modeling and orchestration potential of ExOF for the selected case study, together with the results, obtained for typical 3D models of selected urban block morphology patterns.}

Indeed, the sustainability approach assists the economic analysis leading to appropriate combination methods. Concerning the energetic flow exhausting a solid oxide fuel cell system, this study proposes an innovative trigeneration process with high sustainability index utilizing three stages of sequential heat recovery. The process encompasses a two-stage Rankine cycle boosted by a thermoelectric generator and an ejector refrigeration unit, and a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. This system is simulated in engineering equation solver software and a comprehensive sensitivity study is accomplished. It is concluded that the most influential parameter in the whole framework is the operational temperature of the stack and in the integrated process is turbine 1 pressure. Afterward, an advanced evolutionary optimization method is employed using the MATLAB software, and the optimal point is designated from the sustainability and economic standpoints. The optimal state reveals the sustainability index of 2.61 and total unit cost of 35.93 $/GJ, improved by 12.5% and 3.8% against the base case, respectively. Besides, the electric power, cooling, and hydrogen are correspondingly produced at 389.4 kW, 112.4 kW, and 0.45 kg/h, resulting in exergy efficiency and exergoeconomic factor of 57.75% and 52.1%, respectively.}

This paper describes the development of a process-centric Systems Engineering (SE) reference ontology, based upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 Systems and Software Engineering – Life Cycle Processes [1]. The proposed SE reference ontology extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is a very small top-level ontology (TLO) designed specifically to support the integration of more specific ontologies that extend from it [2]. A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon.}

As a result, a lot of research is going on to develop tools, methods and policies to find and minimize the leakage. The paper proposes a method to provide a measure, especially to the IT organizations to find how the information leakage at one portion of the software can propagate leakage risk to the other portions of the software or entire software. The paper uses the quantitative analysis of information leakage and cost function based statistical method to find the leakage risk propagation in the software. The method proposed in the paper facilitates the organizations by allowing them to set the organization specific parameters. The proposed method has been applied to the function of Linux to demonstrate the information leakage risk propagation. When organizations find information leakage in the software, their sustaining engineering or quality management teams simply rectify the software portion. But it becomes difficult for the organizations to document the overall mitigation of the risk of leakage. Thus, using the proposed method, organizations will be able to quantify the information leakage risk mitigation.}

abstract = {Context:
Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which are challenging to maintain, and evolve in response to changes in stakeholder requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Objective:
The objective of the paper is to re-examine our previous assumptions and arguments in light of advances in the field. This reflection paper provides an opportunity to obtain new insights into the trends in software sustainability in both academia and industry, from a software architecture perspective specifically and software engineering more broadly. Given advances in research in the field, the increasing introduction of academic courses on different sustainability topics, and the engagement of companies to cope with sustainability goals, we reflect on advances and maturity about the role sustainability in general plays in today’s society. More specifically, we revisit the trends, open issues and research challenges identified five years ago in our previous paper on software sustainability research and practice from a software architecture viewpoint, which aimed to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures in order to consider how this paper influenced and motivated research in the intervening years.
Method:
The forward snowballing method was used to establish the methodological basis for our reflection on the state of the art. A total of 234 studies were identified between April 2018 and June 2023 and 102 studies were found to be relevant according to the selection criteria. A further subset was mapped to the primary themes of the original paper including definitions and concepts, reference architectures, measures and metrics, and education.
Vision:
The vision of this reflection paper is to provide a new foundation and road map of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software engineering highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.}

Since sustainability became a challenge in software engineering, researchers mainly from requirements engineering and software architecture communities have contributed to defining the basis of the notion of sustainability-aware software.
Problem
Despite these valuable efforts, the assessment and design based on the notion of sustainability as a software quality is still poorly understood. There is no consensus on which sustainability requirements should be considered.
Aim and Method
To fill this gap, a survey was designed with a double objective: i) determine to which extent quality requirements contribute to the sustainability of software-intensive systems; and ii) identify direct dependencies among the sustainability dimensions. The survey involved different target audiences (e.g. software architects, ICT practitioners with expertise in Sustainability). We evaluated the perceived importance/relevance of each sustainability dimension, and the perceived usefulness of exploiting a sustainability model in different software engineering activities.
Results
Most respondents considered modifiability as relevant for addressing both technical and environmental sustainability. Functional correctness, availability, modifiability, interoperability and recoverability favor positively the endurability of software systems. This study has also identified security, satisfaction, and freedom from risk as very good contributors to social sustainability. Satisfaction was also considered by the respondents as a good contributor to economic sustainability.}

However, in the real decomposition of TPVA, the temperature in the oxidation reactor is not self-sustaining; as a result, the degradation products contain a lot of CO, resulting in more pollution and energy waste. In this paper, jet stirred reactor (JSR) and Chemkin software were used to study the reaction kinetics characteristics of the oxidation process of degradation products from TPVA in the range of 550 °C–700 °C. Both experiments and kinetic simulation show that a higher average temperature of the oxidation reactor is needed to achieve lower CO emissions. When using 5% or 10% TPVA degradation solution, the average temperature should not befall below 625 °C or 675 °C. The corresponding residence time should be greater than 6 s and 5 s respectively. The combination of research findings and engineering practice provides great help to the optimization of the actual work process.}

In this paper, the potentials of MS for engineering tools are shown using the example of a web-based configurator for robot-based automation solutions. On the one hand, the implemented prototype illustrates a possible MS architecture pattern and, on the other hand, clarifies how new functionalities such as the collaborative multi-user configuration or different role-based configuration sessions are enabled by such a concept.

The Requirements Engineering for Well-Being, Aging, and Health (REWBAH) workshop gathering in 2021 focused on addressing the challenge of how Requirements Engineering (RE) knowledge and practices can be applied to the development of information systems that support and promote long-lasting, sustained, and healthier behavior and choices by individuals. An interactive discussion among subject matter experts and practitioners participating in the REWBAH’21 revolved around several questions. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the emerging themes were arranged in the sustainable-health RE (SusHeRE) framework to describe RE processes that address both sustainability and health goals. In this vision paper, we present our framework, which includes four main SusHeRE goals defined according to the changes in RE that we deem necessary for achieving a positive contribution of RE on sustainability and health. These goals involve improved RE Techniques, Multidisciplinary Expertise, Education Agenda, and Public and Social Ecology.}

In grouting engineering, ordinary cement slurry has high viscosity, poor fluidity and groutability and is prone to blockage. In this study, a cement slurry was designed using superfine cement (SC). Fine-grained ultrafine fly ash (UFA) waste was used, part of which is used to replace cement, and a certain amount of nontoxic mSiO2·nH2O (SH) is extracted from limestone waste and mixed with the commonly used admixture polycarboxylic acid water reducer (PAWR) to ensure its physical properties in practical engineering applications while reducing its viscosity, increasing its fluidity, and reducing the occurrence of clogging. To determine the optimal mix ratio of the cement slurries mixed with various materials, the characteristics of each material were analyzed through the single-factor test of the multiperformance test, and the orthogonal test mix ratio was designed based on the single-factor test results. Through the Taguchi grey correlation analysis method, the orthogonal test data were analyzed to find the optimal mix ratio. A performance test of the cement slurry with the optimal mix ratio was carried out, and its sustainability was analyzed. Combined with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Voronoi Calculation Method (VCM) methods, UDEC numerical simulation software is used to simulate and analyze the general laws of cement slurry fluidity. The results show that the cement slurry with the optimal mix ratio of SH, SC, PAWR and UFA materials has good fluidity and groutability, has the characteristics of sustainable development, and can be applied to practical projects.}

abstract = {Complex simulation programs in science and engineering are often built up from a diverse set of existing applications. The large variety of application codes and their high computational demands lead to an increasing utilization of distributed computing systems. Furthermore, the need for developing sustainable simulation programs, especially with regard to ever increasing data sizes, requires a profound flexibility such that application codes and hardware resources can be easily replaced or extended. In this article, we propose a methodology for building complex simulation programs for distributed computing systems. A software library specifically designed to support a client–server-based development of simulation program components is presented. An application example for the simulation and optimization of lightweight structures in mechanical engineering is used to demonstrate the approach.}

abstract = {This study presents a fuzzy logical decision-making algorithm based on block theory to effectively determine discontinuous rock slope reliability under various wedge and planar slip scenarios. The algorithm was developed to provide rapid response operations without the need for extensive quantitative stability evaluations based on the rock slope sustainability ratio. The fuzzy key-block analysis method utilises a weighted rational decision (multi-criteria decision-making) function to prepare the ‘degree of reliability (degree of stability-instability contingency)’ for slopes as implemented through the Mathematica software package. The central and analyst core of the proposed algorithm is provided as based on discontinuity network geometrical uncertainties and hierarchical decision-making. This algorithm uses block theory principles to proceed to rock block classification, movable blocks and key-block identifications under ambiguous terms which investigates the sustainability ratio with accurate, quick and appropriate decisions especially for novice engineers in the context of discontinuous rock slope stability analysis. The method with very high precision and speed has particular matches with the existing procedures and has the potential to be utilised as a continuous decision-making system for discrete parameters and to minimise the need to apply common practises. In order to justify the algorithm, a number of discontinuous rock mass slopes were considered as examples. In addition, the SWedge, RocPlane softwares and expert assignments (25-member specialist team) were utilised for verification of the applied algorithm which led to a conclusion that the algorithm was successful in providing rational decision-making.}

Mechanical activation was applied to activate the HTS, and partial cement was replaced by the reactive HTS. The engineering performance indices of the HTS-SCB slurry, such as the slump, hydraulic conductivity, compressive strength, porosity and leaching risks of heavy metals, were evaluated in this study. The hydration products were identified through a series of analytical tests. The three-dimensional microscale structure of the sample was obtained from the CT experiment, and the microscale geometrical properties were analysed using pore-network models and Avizo software. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was applied to simulate the fluid flow in the HTS-SCB slurry, and the simulated hydraulic conductivities and three-dimensional streamlines were obtained. The results showed that the HTS-SCB slurry had an optimal anti-seepage performance, appropriate mechanical performance and low leaching risks of heavy metals when the cement was replaced by 50 % reactive HTS. The hydration reaction between calcium hydroxide and HTS generates large amounts of fresh calcium silicate hydrates containing Fe and Ti, which fill the pores and contribute to low hydraulic conductivity, micropores (diameter ≤ 2.8 μm) and microflow paths (diameter ≤ 2.5 μm). The LBM results show that the calculated hydraulic conductivities match well with the measured values, and a high tortuosity is obtained from the three-dimensional velocity fields. The HTS-SCB slurry can satisfy the requirement of cut-off walls in land remediation applications and realize solid waste recycling, energy conservation and emission reduction and sustainable development.}

abstract = {Software systems have a strong impact on the energy consumption of the hardware they use. This is especially important for cyber-physical systems where power consumption strongly influences the battery life. For this reason, software developers should be more aware of the energy consumed by their systems. Moreover, software systems should be developed to adapt their behavior to minimize the energy consumed during their execution. This can be done by monitoring the usage context of the system and having runtime support to react to those changes that impact the energy footprint negatively. Although both the hardware and the software parts of cyber-physical systems can be adapted to reduce its energy consumption, this paper focuses on software adaptation. Concretely, the paper illustrates how to address the problem of developing context-aware energy-efficient applications using a Green Eco-Assistant that makes use of advanced software engineering methods, such as Dynamic Software Product Lines and Separation of Concerns. The main steps of our approach are illustrated by applying them to a cyber-physical system case study.}

Unfortunately, these benefits come at the expense of a migration from a family of products to a SPL. Feature Location could be useful in achieving the transition to SPLs. This work presents our FeLLaCaM approach for Feature Location. Our approach calculates similarity to a description of the feature to locate, occurrences where the candidate features remain unchanged, and changes performed to the candidate features throughout the retrospective of the product family. We evaluated our approach in two long-living industrial domains: a model-based family of firmwares for induction hobs that was developed over more than 15 years, and a model-based family of PLC software to control trains that was developed over more than 25 years. In our evaluation, we compare our FeLLaCaM approach with two other approaches for Feature Location: (1) FLL (Feature Location through Latent Semantic Analysis) and (2) FLC (Feature Location through Comparisons). We measure the performance of FeLLaCaM, FLL, and FLC in terms of recall, precision, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve. The results show that FeLLaCaM outperforms FLL and FLC.}

Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes.}

The current system is simulated using the Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS. The thermodynamic calculations are carried out by using the engineering equation solver (EES) software package. This system primarily uses solar energy to produce electricity and as an input energy to the pyrolysis reactor that converts plastic wastes to syngas. Also, the system includes a thermal storage unit to maintain the operation during low solar irradiation. The syngas produced from plastic wastes pyrolysis is processed through a combined cycle to produce electricity. The system generates the electricity at a capacity of 21,601.9 kW. The methane produced is processed through a steam reforming unit to produce hydrogen at a total rate of 0.6 kg/s. The water desalination sub-system produces fresh water through multi effect desalination at a rate of 22.95 kg/s. The energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the overall system are found to be 62.65% and 42.30% respectively.}

Literature has demonstrated a massive amount of digital educational environments in several contexts as being complementary to conventional educational methods. Nevertheless, hosting technical content produced by engineering simulations with educational AR/VR is still challenging and requires expertise from multiple disciplines throughout the technical development. Present work provides a facile and agile methodology for low-cost hardware but content-wise rich AR software development.

A potential application of this conceptually designed system is for a community identified in the Tuscany region of Italy's Larderello field. The proposed system is then analyzed and assessed by utilizing sensitive the thermodynamic simulations and software. The effects of operational and state-related parameters, such as steam, oxygen, waste tire input rate, reference temperature, and gasifier temperature are examined to analyse and evaluate the integrated waste tire gasification system's performance. The present study further aims to determine the effects of varying system parameters and operating circumstances on the ethanol and hydrogen production rates, with the goal of increasing energy and exergy efficiencies while minimizing hazardous wastes and gas emissions. Furthermore, numerous parametric studies on the waste tire-powered multigeneration system are undertaken accordingly. Both Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Aspen Plus software packages are utilized as potential tools to perform analysis andsimulation studiesfor this system. The proposed system is fed with 10 kg/s of waste tires, and the energy production is supported by using 14.7 kg/s of geothermal spring water. While the net electricity generation, cooling and heating capacities of this system are obtained to be 18752 kW, 49236 kW and 5363 kW, respectively, while the total hydrogen and ethanol production rates within the integrated system are found to be 3.02 kg/s and 0.13 kg/s.

abstract = {Context:
Technical excellence is a nebulous term in agile software development. This vagueness is risky because it may lead to misunderstandings and to agile implementations that may overlook a key principle of agile development.
Objective:
This study investigates how agile practitioners interpret the concept of technical excellence brought up in Principle 9 of the Agile manifesto. Moreover, we investigate how agile practitioners put the concept into practice and what conditions facilitate putting technical excellence into practice.
Methods:
We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty agile practitioners, coded the data inductively, and performed two sessions to validate the emerging findings.
Results:
We find that technical excellence is first and foremost a mindset that is underpinned by continuous attention to sustainable code, continuous learning, and teamwork. Fostering technical excellence requires the adoption of design and development practices, such as continuous architecting, and is supported by continuous learning. We also identify three enabling conditions for technical excellence: Leadership support, customer buy-in, and psychological safety. These enablers provide teams with leeway to nurture their pursuit of technical excellence.
Conclusion:
Our findings highlight the key role of people-based strategies in promoting technical excellence in agile software development. They show that the attainment of technical excellence does not only involve technical practices. On the contrary, it relies on social and organizational support and, most importantly, a mindset.}

As a result of the convergence phenomenon, the boundaries between different disciplines are eroding, necessitating a thorough discussion on what engineering education should be like in the future. In this paper, after presenting a brief history of engineering education, the recent paradigm changes are discussed, which essentially stress that skills must prevail over degrees to deal with challenges posed by the trends of the fifth industrial revolution. Later, before concluding the paper four strategies are presented such as lifelong learning and transdisciplinary education (1), sustainability, resilience, and human-centric design modules (2), hands-on data fluency and management courses (3) and human-agent/machine/robot/computer interaction experiences (4).}

Today, collected data is often stored in arbitrary data formats without appropriate metadata describing the data content and is therefore lost for future reuse because crucial information on how to find, access and interoperate with the data is missing. Moreover, insufficiently described or missing data can lead to wrong decisions. In a scientific context, the FAIR data principles are an emerging design guideline to provide all collected data with rich metadata that allow for finding, accessing, interoperating with and reusing the data effectively later. This publication proposes an approach to implement the FAIR principles for industrial sensor data. It analyses major deficits and challenges of making industrial sensor data FAIR and outlines a system architecture for acquisition of FAIR industrial sensor data, called FAIR sensor services.}

The data was gathered from the Web of Science database and analyzed by the Visualization Of Similarities software. This work focused on: i) publication and citation trends, ii) scientific categories, iii) countries' contribution to the topic of cavitation, iv) prominent journals, v) keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis, and vi) keyword evolution analysis. Results showed a significant increase in publications during the past 5 years. The scientific categories with the highest number of publications were “environmental sciences” and “environmental engineering,” with a combined share of 19.4 % of publications. Keywords evolution analysis showed that limited focus was given to topics related to “energy” and “energy efficiency” in the field of cavitation, but with the rising importance of each process's sustainability, the attention given to these concepts will increase in the future. Future directions for the topic of cavitation-related water and wastewater treatments will shift towards more environmentally friendly applications of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic cavitation as well as towards more green and sustainable approaches to address the increasing water pollution problems and shortage. Moreover, it will include other uses besides water treatment such as manufacturing nanomaterials food production and medicine.}

The paper aims to discuss these issues, focusing on the energy efficient refurbishment on two university campuses in Milan, Italy. A Methodology for Energy Efficient Building Refurbishment (MEEBR) has been identified and tested on two case studies with students of the Integrated Design Refurbishment Laboratory of Building Engineering Faculty at POLIMI. In particular, the performance energy analyses were conducted on two university building case: the first at POLIMI campus, and the second located in the Università degli Studi di Milano (UNIMI) campus. These analyses were carried out using numerical simulations, considering the increasing important role which software are playing in refurbishment building design process also in early design phase. This preliminary experience with students on MEEBR application, with also the overview on building refurbishment methodologies, show that case study examples can help to: increase consideration of the integrated research approach and improve sustainability performance in historical buildings taking into account also the user’s participation of a university campus. The comparison of the energy assessment methodology, of the two software used for the analyses (CENED+ and Sefaira), leads to the statement that it is essential from the beginning, selecting a program in function of the particular job and the outputs that you want to reach with the tool.}

Owing to the critical role of software-intensive systems in society, software engineers have the accountability to consider sustainability as a goal while structuring a software system. However, there are no practical guidelines providing a tangible decomposition of the sustainability aspect. Moreover, there are limited quantifiable methods to support sustainable design and analysis.
Objectives:
The purpose of this study is to help software practitioners to take sustainability into account by providing systematic guidelines for the software engineering process. We propose a framework that presents a meta model to decompose sustainability requirements and an assessment approach to evaluate sustainability achievements.
Method:
This work presents an integrated framework that combines a goal-based approach, scenario-based approach, and feature modeling to gather sustainability related requirements and corresponding features. For sustainability assessment, software analysis and machine learning techniques are utilized to analyze software products based on sustainability metrics and criteria.
Results and Conclusions:
The empirical study conducted with participants from academia and industry revealed that the proposed framework improves participant’s ability to consider sustainability aspect in their software engineering tasks through focusing on requirements, design, and evaluation. With the provided sustainability meta-model, the participants could extract more stakeholders, requirements, and features in shorter time. Moreover, the empirical study result also demonstrated that this study is capable to indicate specific scenarios that should be redesigned to improve the sustainability achievements level.}

abstract = {Paper deals in-depth with the topic of sustained stress indices applicable to 90° elbows based on non-linear finite element analysis models. A comprehensive overview of the existing literature sources is given in the first part of the paper, showing that there are little sources which deal specifically with this topic and that the ones that do exist result in important scatter of the results. As a result, more than few of the existing sources are non-conservative in their nature. Dedicated non-linear finite element studies have been performed on shell and solid models which are used in conjunction with the regression analysis in order to obtain explicit equations which can be used to calculate both in- and out-plane sustained stress indices in 90° pipe elbows, which can then be used in the typical pipe stress analysis. Newly proposed equations prove to be a good fit for the numerical data, showing little deviation as shown by the correlation parameters presented in the paper. Final part of the paper presents a dedicated section on the high wall thickness elbows and shows the relationship between elbow wall thickness and maximum stress location. It is shown that beyond certain thickness, the maximum stress location shifts from the typical failure location (i.e., side wall) to the locations which are not typically expected (i.e., intrados or even away from elbow). This shifting may have an important effect on the theoretical models which assume failure location.}

Nonetheless, they have poor performance when machined. In this study, magnetic field diamond turning (MFDT) was used to increase the thermal conductivity and thus the machinability of machined Ti-6Al-4 V alloy parts, as well as the lifetime of the diamond cutting tool. The thermal properties of the work material under a magnetic field were investigated using ABAQUS software. The simulation results were validated by the cutting experiments, which demonstrated improved machining performance, increased tool life, and enhanced thermal properties of the machined parts. The surface morphology such as surface defects and surface roughness and microstructure modifications were investigated as evidence. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the MFDT on the machinability of titanium alloys as the thermal conductivity increases, resulting in increased tool life and improved machined surface quality reached to more than 60% for achieving sustainable diamond machining.}

While the size of a company is becoming less essential, the ability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and new technologies is more important than ever. This trend particularly applies to the companies’ software landscapes, where individual sub-processes and services must be orchestrated, seamlessly integrated, and iteratively renewed according to the ever-increasing user requirements. However, inflexible, closed monolithic software applications as well as self-programmed stand-alone tools that are difficult to integrate are still predominant in the engineering domain. A complete reimplementation of existing, proprietary engineering tools and their integration into monolithic applications of large software providers is often not economically feasible, especially for small and medium-sized machinery and plant manufacturers. In this context, the so-called Process-Driven Approach (PDA) offers a sustainable and tool-neutral opportunity for process and tool orchestration, enabling an easy integration of individual software applications by consistent utilization of the separation of concerns principle. The PDA, originating from business informatics, is mainly based on the standardized and machine-executable visual modeling language Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Using the semantic enhancements found in version 2.0, BPMN is not just used to model the business processes but also to model and execute the integration processes between different systems. After the PDA has already been successfully applied to large-scale projects in business informatics, it is now being transferred to the engineering domain. As shown in this paper, PDA allows to orchestrate the different processes in engineering and to integrate the underlying software tools, such as e-mail or spreadsheet applications, engineering tools, or custom microservices, using standardized interfaces like REST API. In doing so, engineering processes can be made more transparent, monitored, and optimized by means of appropriate key figures. The concept is validated by a prototypical implementation of a minimum functional PDA architecture for the engineering domain.}

This manufacturing process is also frequently used when it is needed to manufacture unique parts to replace degraded or damaged components and spare parts that are no longer available. In this reverse engineering process, particular attention must be given to the constitutive models of materials. The 3D printing manufacturing process usually requires a change of materials and introduces or increases the anisotropy. In addition, the complexity of part geometries and loading often requires using the finite element method to simulate their behaviour in service. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the materials frequently used in 3D Printing for its sustainability, affordability, and mechanical and thermal properties. In this study, a bushing of a hinged drawer support is reverse-engineered, and its in-service behaviour is simulated before it is manufactured using Tough PLA material through 3D printing.

A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners.
Method
We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015.
Results
We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems.
Conclusion
SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.}

As almost all modern product developments, the manufacture is based on the creation and consistent use of digital models. Quality of underlying data can vary greatly and it is not certain that digital models match the actual state of construction. This can result in the need for rework after production or installation. Especially challenging in the area of premium products, for which high quality, scarce materials are used and tight schedules are defined. If physical products are reworked, the corresponding digital models must be manually maintained. At present, attempts are being made to counteract these late adjustments by means of physical mock-ups or visual inspection of 3D scan data. Such scan data is used for automated adaptation of underlying digital models to the actual state of the physical construction. Existing Point Cloud Library functionalities were adapted and further algorithms were designed. The developed software backend was integrated into the existing software architecture. During the software development, great care was taken to ensure that the backend is based on open source content. The results show significant improvements of the data basis for the subsequent engineering activities. This will lead to a significant reduction of manual effort and rework, ensuring development cycles and even shorten delivery times. It reduces costs in the product creation process and sustainably strengthens confidence in digital models used. It has been shown that automation of design processes can have productivity-enhancing effects in one-off construction.}

Therefore, and even due to the strong interdependencies between the engineering disciplines and the individual objectives, a ‘true’ holistic and integrated sustainable selection of the actual (functional) design, manufacturing and material aspect is inevitable.

The studies show that the SRCFST member exhibits an elastoplastic behaviour subjected to the coupling effect of initial stress on steel tube and sustained load. However, the creep ratio undergoes a change from linear to nonlinear by increasing long-term load or initial stress ratio. Finally, a method for calculating the creep in SRCFST columns under combined loads is provided, and the long-term performance can be better predicted.}

abstract = {Context:
In the livestock domain, technologies are developed to sustainably raise animal production. However, the domain is critical, since animals are very sensitive to variables such as temperature and humidity, which can cause diseases and consequent production losses and discomfort. Livestock production systems then demand monitoring, reasoning, and acting on the environment so that the levels of those variables are preserved in pre-established intervals and undesired conditions are predicted, avoided, and mitigated with automated actions.
Objective:
The main contribution of this article is presenting E-SECO, a software ecosystem platform, and its evolution that encapsulates a new self-adaptive component to tackle animal production decisions, named e-Livestock architecture.
Method:
Two case studies were conducted involving a real system derived from the E-SECO platform encompassing a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place.
Results:
Results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract disruptive technologies based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence and accommodate them in a single architecture for that specific domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of a self-adaptive architecture to support engineering a complex system for a livestock sub-domain (milk production), and (iii) support empirical studies in a real smart farm towards a future transfer of technology to industry.
Conclusion:
The results showed that the E-SECO platform, which encompasses e-livestock architecture, can support monitoring, reasoning, prediction, and automated actions in a milk production/Compost Barn environment.}

abstract = {The use of natural composites in modern engineering applications has numerous benefits owing to their excellent sustainable attributes and negligible environmental impacts. The full commercialization of natural composites as alternative materials to conventional ones is undermined by environmental factors such as moisture content leading to varied shrinkage and swelling behaviors. Uncontrolled shrinkage behavior can often lead to premature split in natural composites. The aim of this study is to investigate the fracture mechanisms due to directional shrinkage in natural composite material through numerical simulation by considering the finite element modelling software of LS-DYNA. From numerical results, directional shrinkage could be seen to clearly affect the fracture patterns in natural composites as compared to the control one. The fracture patterns, which indicated a narrowed region of stress concentration in the material, is assumed to emanate from internally induced forces in the material, namely tensile and compressive forces. This specific pattern is associated to longitudinal split failure typically observed in orthotropic materials. Results of this study can be useful to further investigate the complex fracture behavior in natural composite materials to better understand their durability limitations.}

Concrete is an agglomeration of materials involving aggregates,gravel, cement, sand, and water. Upon mixing with water, the cohesive mix solidifies and hardens through a process called hydration. With numerous advantages to offer viz being more economical, ability to harden at ambient temperature, ability to mould in any shape, good water resistance characteristics, to name a few, concrete has gained tremendous popularity in civil engineering works. But the question arises if concrete is a sustainable material, and whether we are using it in the quantum that it could be made available for future generations with the resources being a constraint. This work focuses on the Life cycle assessment of construction materials with focal point being Concrete and Timber. The work adopts bamboo in the form of timber for replacement.

Nevertheless, due to their relatively high complexity and implementation costs, RAS are only used to a limited extent by small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. As a rule, the high costs of RAS arise from custom engineering efforts, which take up to 70 percent of the acquisition costs. For this reason, it is necessary to optimise the engineering of RAS. However, software tools such as configurators have been used primarily for the individualisation of products, such as automobiles or clothing, based on variants predefined by the manufacturer, and less for the engineering of automation solutions. The development of knowledge-based systems, in particular knowledge-based engineering configurators (EC), is usually performed by few proficient experts with high development effort. One of the primary challenges in the knowledge acquisition is that several experts possess partial aspects of knowledge in an inhomogeneous, implicit form. Furthermore, there is a lack of efficient development methods for EC. By reusing knowledge elements from previous development projects, a sustainable increase in efficiency is possible. In order to enable an efficient development process of EC, we introduce a structuring model consisting of four knowledge domains (KD): knowledge about specific business cases (KD1), Best Practices as case-specific solution knowledge (KD2), logical expert knowledge (KD3) as well as semantically consistent data models for interoperability of different IT systems (KD4). As the four KD are independent, their development can be agilely divided among several teams or companies. Finally, the agile development approach is validated individually for each KD as well as comprehensively within the scope of the ROBOTOP platform for planning RAS.}

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is increasingly adopted as the leading information technology tool emerging in the AEC industry. Thanks to its advantages, especially the generation of a virtual model centralising all the information concerning the different trades involved and the effective interoperability, BIM has greatly helped construction projects reach a mature performance level. However, some phases in the AE lack interoperability and information exchange efficiency. This inefficiency is much more critical in the case of design and structural projects. In this respect, this study aims to conduct and integrate BIM into an AE process to analyse and improve the degree of efficiency of a structural project. For this purpose, a real case study on a high-standing villa was conducted. The BIM process was implemented based on the spirit of collaboration and interoperability with both Revit® and Robot® software. The results describe the BIM process’s ease of modelling, verification, transfer, exchange, and error detection. Thus, the speed, ease of modification, and decision-making. Thus, the rate of improvement and decision-making. The paper joins the body of studies seeking to reposition the AEC industry. It develops a Framework between Revit and Robot at the professional level, valid for all structural projects. For the scientific community, the study proposes innovation in AEC as a field of research to achieve the desired performance and sustainability.

In order to assess their sustainability performance, companies often use the widespread life cycle assessment (LCA) as defined by ISO 14040 and supported by various LCA software solutions. However, this is regularly associated with well-known shortcomings such as difficulties in gaining appropriate life cycle inventory data, lack of result transferability, and the amount of time needed for LCA studies. To overcome these problems, approaches for automating the LCA process have proven to be promising in other engineering disciplines (e.g., civil engineering). However, hardly any approaches to automating the LCA of manufacturing processes exist. Based on an extensive literature review, this paper presents a concept for an automated LCA of manufacturing processes. The approach consists of three steps and covers the phases of data extraction, LCA model building, and analysis. It is geared towards using implicitly existing manufacturing information and facilitating the so far mostly manual data collection and modeling processes. To conclude, an outlook is given on how the proposed concept will be further developed in an industrial setting.}

To that end, modern software needs to provide creative features to improve sustainability. To advance software creativity, research has proposed several techniques, including multi-day workshops involving experienced requirements analysts, and semi-automated tools to support creative thinking in a limited scope. Such approaches are either useful only for software with already rich issue tracking systems, or require substantial engagement from analysts with creative minds. In a recent work, we have demonstrated a novel framework that is beneficial for both novel and existing software and allows end-to-end automation promoting creativity. The framework reuses requirements from similar software freely available online, utilizes advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, and leverages the concept of requirement boilerplate to generate candidate creative requirements. An application of our framework on software domains: Antivirus, Web Browser, and File Sharing followed by a human subject evaluation have shown promising results. In this invited extension, we present further analysis for our research questions and report an additional evaluation by human subjects. The results exhibit the framework’s ability in generating creative features even for a relatively matured application domain, such as Web Browser, and provoking creative thinking among developers irrespective of their experience levels.}

This article is pioneered with the forward engineering of SICI combustion engine for plug-in hybrid biofuel-electric vehicles (PHBEVs) by optimizing the high-efficiency region of SICI combustion system for the PHBEV with dynamic programming (DP)-based case studies, after which the DHE prototype is produced using one-dimension and three-dimension engine digital twin models. Further, experimental test data of the optimized DHE is used to model the PHBEV in GT-Suite and MATLAB/Simulink software, and its charge-sustaining (CS) performance with rule-based control and adaptive equivalent minimization control strategy (A-ECMS) under both homologation and real-world driving cycles is evaluated and compared with the offline DP. The results show that the SICI combustion engine-based PHBEV with ethanol blending from E20 to E100 can reduce the well-to-wheel (WTW) CO2 emissions by 28% to 75%, respectively, where more than 7% of the reduction is contributed by control system optimization using A-ECMS.

However, the machining of Ti-6Al-4V generates high cutting temperature due to poor thermal conductivity. This high cutting temperature triggers chemical reactivity of the alloy with the tool material and accelerates the edge wear. Therefore, the cryogenic coolants are used to improve the cutting performance, but their poor lubrication allows for high cutting forces. Hybrid lubri-coolants could be an alternative to reduce the temperature efficiently. The simulation of hybrid lubri-coolants by Finite Element Modeling (FEM) is an interesting to explore the high-performance cutting of hard titanium alloy. The current study compares the cutting temperatures using DEFORM® FEM simulations software and to foresee the cutting temperatures in milling Ti-6Al-4V at various levels of cutting speeds Vc (100–300 m/min), and feed per tooth fz 0.08–0.12 mm/z and under effect of hybrid lubri-coolants (ethanol, ester oil, and hybrid ethanol-ester oil). Initially, the 2D milling models were developed and predicted results were compared to milling experiments. The comparison of experimental and simulation cutting temperatures revealed a maximum of 6.5 % error. Thus, it can be concluded that 2D modeling is an effective tool to predict the milling temperatures within a reasonable error.}

abstract = {Waste-to-energy incineration is an effective and sustainable solution to reduce produced waste and simultaneously generates electricity utilizing thermal energy. The waste-to-electrical efficiency of conventional incineration plants is limited to 20–25% due to the higher amount of moisture content in the feedstock and flue gas heat losses. In addition, tubes of the incineration boiler are subjected to corrosion problems at elevated temperatures. In the present research, a parabolic trough solar-integrated municipal solid waste power plant is proposed and thermodynamically evaluated for different useful outputs. The solar energy is harvested through parabolic trough collectors to reheat the working fluid of the incineration plant to increase the steam temperature before it is fed to the low-pressure turbine. Meanwhile, a single-effect absorption chiller is integrated to utilize the thermal energy of the trough collectors for cooling purposes. In addition, the thermal energy of flue gas is used to power an organic Rankine cycle that further drives a proton exchange membrane and reverse osmosis desalination unit for hydrogen and freshwater production, respectively. In this way, the steam temperature for reheating the low-pressure turbine is increased to further improve the performance of the proposed solar-integrated waste-to-energy plant without causing any corrosion problems to the incineration boiler. The integrated facility is thermodynamically analyzed based on a 560-tons/day incineration plant using the engineering equation solver (EES) software. The results indicate that the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed plant are 32.51% and 23.7%, respectively, while the coefficient of performance of the absorption chiller is 0.849. Moreover, it is concluded that the produced desalinated water and hydrogen rates are 23.96 kg/s and 0.000857 kg/s, respectively.}

abstract = {The multiple-unit sustained-release (MUSR) dosage forms containing numerous sustained-release subunits present a reliable choice for oral formulation of controlled release systems. As a typical MUSR, the metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablet is an advanced system with limited researches devoted to relating its structure to the drug release phase other than the preparation process and modulation to the release behaviors. This research details a three-dimension method to image the internal structure and detail drug release features of commercial metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets and component individual single pellets. As such, a new perspective for MUSR dosage form is provided. Using high energy synchrotron radiation X-ray microcomputed tomography (SR-μCT), the in-situ structure parameters were obtained nondestructively. It was demonstrated that the average number of spherical pellets in a tablet was 853 ± 12 (n = 3). The average volume of the pellets was 0.09 ± 0.01 mm3, the diameter was 0.55 ± 0.03 mm, and the sphericity was 0.87 ± 0.06. These data reflected the numerical features of pellets in MUSR tablets, which were helpful for reverse engineering to MUSR. Based on the three dimensional model generated by image processing and analysis software, the pellet structures were divided into three layers of typical depot sustained release system: pellet core, drug-containing layer and outer film. The dynamic structural features determined refer to the changes of structures in pellets during in vitro drug release, with evidence that the coating layer on the pellets maintained a spherical morphology whilst numerous valleys appeared on the surface. The material constitution and distribution in coating layer were evaluated by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared mapping and results indicated a composition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose dispersed in ethyl cellulose. Knowledge of these structural characteristics confirmed that the mechanism of sustained drug release was membrane controlled and consistent with the drug release profiles. In conclusion, the structural investigation provided knowledge of the intrinsic quality of metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets and offers guidance for reverse engineering of MUSR.}

To ensure an application-specific manifestation of the product development process for three exemplary use cases from small and medium-sized enterprises but also large corporations in the area of prosthetics, bike construction and plant engineering, the individually developed methods and tools are first generalized in order to make them adaptable to a wide variety of industries. As a result, one lightweight-specific method or tool (e.g., function mass analysis, “PPM solution correlator“ or “2D layout & weight drafting”) is introduced in more detail for all stages of the technically extended RFL(T)P approach derived from model-based systems engineering (MBSE).}

This article explains the comparative advantages of Geosynthetic Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls over four other conventional types (Plain Concrete Gravity walls; Reinforced Concrete Cantilever walls; Masonry Brick walls; and Gabion Limestone Cage walls) from a sustainability perspective over various heights. The study comprises a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) following the ISO 14040 and 14044 frameworks. The results revealed that constructing MSE walls rather than the other conventional walls contributes to 10 of the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GaBi's software and embedded database were utilized for the first time in such an assessment. The article demonstrated that the construction of gravity walls requires large amounts of cement/concrete, which emit a significant amount of geogenic CO2. In contrast, the construction of MSE walls requires considerably less concrete and more backfill. The construction of cantilever walls requires less concrete than gravity, yet more than MSE walls for their construction. The structure of masonry walls was found to have less impact on the environment than the construction of comparable gravity and cantilever walls. The benefits of MSE walls over conventional walls increased with increasing wall height. The significant benefit comes from using soil backfill as the chief structural component rather than concrete. This article is deemed an essential step in achieving circularity and circular economy regarding sustainable earth fill retaining structures.}

The methodology incorporated 3D geometric data obtained by Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), location and information of green infrastructure, and meteorological data (direction and velocity of wind) into a single 3D BIM model to estimate the potential levels of exposure to urban green infrastructure by applying a modified aerobiological index to create risk maps for ornamental trees (AIROT). The BIM model facilitated a 3D visualisation of the exposure in urban environments by exporting information to GIS software, which could then be visualised on Google Earth. The main advance of the developed methodology is its applicability to any urban environment for determining and reducing aerobiological health risks in civil engineering.}

Missing analysis methods as well as missing awareness of the importance are obstacles in decision making. Therefore, a multi-criterial analysis method for handling systems for decision empowerment is presented in this paper. The presented methodology enables the engineer to analyze the suppliers for decision making in the purchasing process as well as the identification of weak points regarding sustainability in the handling systems. The methodology offers the possibility of analyzing a system of several parts as a whole, rather than just individual parts. The methodology is implemented in a usable software prototype which has a graphical interface for the data input and can be connected to conventional databases. The usability of the tool is shown with a handling system consisting of an industrial robot and a gripping system.}

These methods are based on a flexible three-stage process synthesis-design-innovation approach that can be used to solve different types of process engineering problems. This flexible approach can be used for solving new process synthesis problems, retrofit design problems or can be used as a process analysis tool to study any chemical process in detail. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the following aspects: How to solve complex process synthesis, design, and innovation problems by breaking them into small hierarchical subproblems and solving them efficiently and consistently so that one can obtain innovative and sustainable solutions. This work also highlights the degree of digitalization that can be achieved by using computer-aided tools like ProCAFD. The integration of ProCAFD with other computer-aided tools, including commercial simulation software to enhance the application range and scope of ProCAFD is also highlighted.}

Each of the approaches has certain exclusive principles, practices, thinking, and values, which are informally represented, implemented, and improperly institutionalized. Ontologies are developed for the representation, assessment, and adaptation of SDAs separately without having a shared terminology which may lead to terminological conflict and confusion affecting the simultaneous representation and implementation in software development industry and academia. The software engineering approaches does not consider and support sustainability as priority concern. However, the approaches have capabilities of supporting sustainable software development in different sustainability aspects. This research article aims for the designing and development of an integrated ontology of software engineering approaches (i.e., agile, lean, and green) named OntoSuSD (ontology for sustainable software development) to support sustainable software development knowledge, awareness, and implementation. The goal of OntoSuSD is to propose, design and develop a formal, generic, consistent, and shared knowledge base containing semantic terminology and description of concepts and relationships generated around the representation and implementation of lean, agile, and green approaches in software development processes, which will facilitate their simultaneous implementation and assessment for sustainable software development. The OntoSuSD is developed using practical ontology engineering methodology by reusing relevant ontologies and explicit concepts and properties are defined to fulfill knowledge requirements and representations of the domain. The OntoSuSD is evaluated, and results infer OntoSuSD has high ontological design, good domain coverage, potential applications and achieves purpose of the ontology development.},

abstract = {Abstract Sustainable living, ie, living within the bounds of the available environmental, social, and economic resources, is the focus of many present-day social and scientific discussions. But what does sustainability mean within the context of software engineering? In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of 8 case studies to address this question within the context of a specific software engineering approach, software product line engineering (SPLE). We identify the sustainability-related characteristics that arise in present-day studies that apply SPLE. We conclude that technical and economic sustainability are in prime focus on the present SPLE practice, with social sustainability issues, where they relate to organisations, also addressed to a good degree. On the other hand, the issues related to the personal sustainability are less prominent, and environmental considerations are nearly completely amiss. We present feature models and cross-relations that result from our analysis as a starting point for sustainability engineering through SPLE, suggesting that any new development should consider how these models would be instantiated and expanded for the intended sociotechnical system. The good representation of sustainability features in these models is also validated with 2 additional case studies.},

abstract = {Abstract Cloud systems provide elastic execution environments of resources that link application and infrastructure/platform components, which are both exposed to uncertainties and change. Change appears in 2 forms: the evolution of architectural components under changing requirements and the adaptation of the infrastructure running applications. Cloud architecture continuity refers to the ability of a cloud system to change its architecture and maintain the validity of the goals that determine the architecture. Goal validity implies the satisfaction of goals in adapting or evolving systems. Architecture continuity aids technical sustainability, that is, the longevity of information, systems, and infrastructure and their adequate evolution with changing conditions. In a cloud setting that requires both steady alignment with technological evolution and availability, architecture continuity directly impacts economic sustainability. We investigate change models and change rules for managing change to support cloud architecture continuity. These models and rules define transformations of architectures to maintain system goals: Evolution is about unanticipated change of structural aspects of architectures, and adaptation is about anticipated change of architecture configurations. Both are driven by quality and cost, and both represent multidimensional decision problems under uncertainty. We have applied the models and rules for adaptation and evolution in research and industry consultancy projects.},

abstract = {Abstract In the quest for energy efficient Information and Communication Technology, research has mostly focused on the role of hardware. However, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, due to cost and time constraints, many software producing organizations are unable to effectively measure software energy consumption preventing them to include energy efficiency in the product roadmap. In this paper, we apply a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a commercial software product across 2 consecutive releases. We demonstrate how the method can be applied and provide an in-depth analysis of energy consumption of software components. Additionally, we investigate the added value of these measurement for multiple stakeholders in a software producing organization, by means of semistructured interviews. Our results show how the introduction of an encryption module caused a noticeable increase in the energy consumption of the product. Such results were deemed valuable by the stakeholders and provided insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption. In addition, our interviews show that such a quantification of software energy consumption helps to create awareness and eventually consider energy efficiency aspects when planning software releases.},

In this paper, we aim at empirically assessing their relationship to energy consumption, ie, a performance indicator that has recently attracted the attention of both researchers and practitioners. To achieve this goal, we investigate pattern-participating methods (ie, those that play a role within the pattern) and compare their energy consumption to the consumption of functionally equivalent alternative (nonpattern) solutions. We obtained the alternative solution by refactoring the pattern instances using well-known transformations (eg, replace polymorphism with conditional statements). The comparison is performed on 169 methods of 2 GoF patterns (namely, State/Strategy and Template Method), retrieved from 2 well-known open source projects. The results suggest that for the majority of cases the alternative design excels in terms of energy consumption. However, in some cases (eg, when the method is large in size or invokes many methods) the pattern solution presents similar or lower energy consumption. The outcome of our study can be useful to both researchers and practitioners, because we: (1) provide evidence on a possible negative effect of GoF patterns, and (2) can provide guidance on which cases the use of the pattern is not hurting energy consumption.},

abstract = {Abstract With the resource-constrained nature of mobile devices and the resource-abundant offerings of the cloud, several promising optimisation techniques have been proposed by the green computing research community. Prominent techniques and unique methods have been developed to offload resource intensive tasks from mobile devices to the cloud. Although these schemes address similar questions within the same domain of mobile cloud application (MCA) optimisation, evaluation is tailored to the scheme and also solely mobile focused, thus making it difficult to clearly compare with other existing counterparts. In this work, we first analyse the existing/commonly adopted evaluation technique, then with the aim to fill the above gap, we propose the behaviour-driven full-tier green evaluation approach, which adopts the behaviour-driven concept for evaluating MCA performance and energy usage—ie, green metrics. To automate the evaluation process, we also present and evaluate the effectiveness of a resultant application program interface and tool driven by the behaviour-driven full-tier green evaluation approach. The application program interface is based on Android and has been validated with Elastic Compute Cloud instance. Experiments show that Beftigre is capable of providing a more distinctive, comparable, and reliable green test results for MCAs.},

abstract = {Abstract Connected health applications are efficient tools to improve health care services. The aim of this paper is to define a reusable requirements repository (catalog) for sustainable connected health applications based on the main related software engineering standards, e-health technology standards, and literature. The catalog contains requirements which cover the individual, social, environmental, and technical dimensions of sustainability. The requirements presented in this paper can be very useful to connected health application stakeholders and can be adapted to specific m-health applications. Moreover, the requirements catalog can be used to generate a checklist of requirements to evaluate and audit connected health applications. An application example is presented to show that the evaluation of connected health applications using the generated checklist is realistic.},
