	abstract = {Energy and carbon efficiency has become one of the most important research topics in the cloud computing research area because of the growing demand for cloud data center infrastructures. In addition to the environmental impact of emitting carbon, local authorities impose a carbon tax based on the amount of emitted carbon by the data centers. Therefore, this paper introduces the energy and carbon-aware initial VM placement (ECAIVMP), one of the most efficient strategies for minimizing the total energy consumption and carbon emission of cloud data centers without sacrificing the quality of service. Our proposed algorithm considers multiple geo-distributed cloud data centers and acknowledges both IT and non-IT power usage during the virtual machine placement process. An extensive simulation in the CloudSim Plus framework is conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm using real-world datasets, including workloads, power model benchmarks, and outside temperature. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce energy consumption by 17% and carbon emissions by 6% on average compared to other competitor algorithms.},

@article{ONER2023100889,
	abstract = {Considering the increasing demand for cloud computing, and the financial and environmental impact of the increasing energy consumption trend of data centers, improving energy efficiency is vital for cloud service providers. In this study, an energy-aware virtual machine scheduling model is proposed which is based on the multi-unit nondiscriminatory combinatorial auction. The model includes a powerful bidding language that allows users to declare their complicated virtual machine requests using logical AND and OR relations along with the time constraints. The study also presents the formal definition of the model and the associated optimization problem for determining the optimum schedule and energy-efficient placement of VMs on physical servers. The optimization problem is formulated using integer linear programming and several heuristic solution methods including the Genetic Algorithm are proposed for this problem. The performances of the model and the proposed heuristics are assessed on a comprehensive test suite. The proposed model is estimated to provide approximately a 37% improvement in revenues, and the solution methods are estimated to provide high-quality solutions within only 5% of the optimum which enable the model to be deployed in large-scale clouds.},

@article{DANTHULURI20233069,
	abstract = {Cloud computing has become one of the most important platforms for various applications like artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, and others, especially demand for cloud computing has exploded in recent years. Because of the increased demand for cloud computing, it has become more complex, which can lead to software or hardware failure. Due to the advanced infrastructure, failure may not be detected and repaired at a given timeline and will end up costing higher. In addition, the advent of cloud computing has another advantage over the massive spread of scientific work. Scientific workflow refers to a series of computations that enable data analysis in a distributed and systematic way; because this work flow has a large number of works, energy consumption is a major problem. Besides these issues, it also suffers from system reliability; in the response to these issues, several researchers have designed their mechanism, however they failed to understand cloud complex environment. Therefore, here we have designed a mechanism that efficiently reduces energy consumption, improve the fault tolerance to achieve reliability, performs operations in very less time, and optimize the cost in the workflow model. We have also demonstrated efficient energy optimization techniques by reducing task loads.},

@article{WANG2023126585,
	abstract = {High-efficiency uninterruptable power supplies and sustainable energy systems are essential to realize data centers more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Considering the coupling between computing tasks and power consumption, this paper proposes a coordinated optimization model of operational scheduling of integrated energy system (IES) for data center according to computing load transfer. An IES consisting of solar photovoltaic arrays, gas engine, and organic Rankine cycle is proposed and optimized to obtain the optimum component capacities. Then, the computing tasks of servers with task shifting are modeled to characterize the arrival time, execution time, and deadline of different tasks. The operation scheduling optimization model of components in the IES with the computing task transfer is proposed to minimize the operating costs of data center and maximize the user satisfaction level of computing tasks. The impacts of objective weights on the dispatch strategies of the IES and computing tasks are discussed. The optimization results in a case study demonstrate that the data center can effectively realize the transfer of electricity and cooling loads by transferring computing tasks to improve the IES performances. The optimum dispatch strategies with task transfer saves operational cost and fuel consumption by 2.76% and 2.56%, respectively, and the carbon dioxide emission is reduced by 6.31% in non-heating season. Their benefits in heating season are 3.47%, 4.11%, and 2.17%, respectively.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3607947.3607970,
	abstract = {Dynamic virtual machine scheduling is a crucial research area in cloud computing, to optimize resource utilization, reduce energy consumption, and ensuring performance and availability by dynamically managing and scheduling virtual machines (VMs) across servers. Effective dynamic VM scheduling can significantly impact the efficiency and sustainability of data centers by efficiently allocating resources based on workload demand. However, the dynamic nature of workload demand presents one of the primary challenges in dynamic VM scheduling. Sudden spikes or drops in server resource usage can lead to severe SLA violation concerns and energy inefficiency. To mitigate these challenges, scheduling algorithms need to balance the workload demand across servers while ensuring that servers are not overloaded or underloaded. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art techniques for dynamic VM scheduling, evaluating their performance based on several key factors, including objective function, approach, the technique of VM scheduling, VM placement approach, VM selection approach, and server underload and overload detection techniques. Our comparison highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and provides insights into the design of efficient dynamic VM scheduling algorithms. The findings of this work can guide the development of novel techniques that address the challenges of dynamic VM scheduling and improve the efficiency and sustainability of data centers.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a hierarchical approach to the problem of energy-aware task allocation in a distributed HPC system consisting of several computing clusters. The solution involves the control of clusters and the use of network traffic engineering methods to minimize overall energy consumption. The advantages of the hierarchical approach are twofold: first entities controlling parts of computing infrastructure may decide how much of their responsibility is delegated to the coordinator, next the computational complexity of related mathematical programming problems may be reduced, and their solution may be done in parallel. The mathematical programming problem of task allocation is defined in the centralized form first. After discussing its computation complexity and related organizational difficulties, it is decomposed to form a hierarchy. Finally, heuristics for allocation are proposed and verified via numerical simulation.},

Like demand increases, other factors require grid infrastructure improvement, updates, and opening to other technologies that assuage the final customer needs. Precisely, the interest in renewable energy sources, the constant evolution of energy storage technologies, the continuous research involving microgrid management systems, and the evolution of cloud computing technologies and machine learning strategies motivate the development of this article. Tasks associated with a microgrid cluster like the integration of a considerable number of heterogeneous devices, real-time support, information processing, massive storage capabilities, security considerations, and advanced optimization techniques usage could take place in an autonomous and scalable energy management system architecture under a machine learning perspective running in real-time and using Cloud resources. This paper focuses on identifying the elements considered by different authors to define a cloud-based architecture and ensure the appropriately supervised learning functionality under a microgrids cluster environment. Namely, it was necessary to revise and run microgrid simulations, real-time simulation platforms usage, connection to a virtual server for microgrid control and set the energy management system using cloud computing and machine learning. Based on the review and considering the scenarios mentioned, this article presents a scalable and autonomous cloud-based architecture that allows power generation forecast, energy consumption prediction, a real-time energy management system using machine learning techniques.},

	abstract = {Difficulty in power supply has always been the main factor hindering the sustainable development of islands. It is an effective way to address the energy supply issue of off-grid islands by building island microgrid system with abundant renewable energy, such as wind energy and solar energy. However, island microgrids offer a mix of the high penetration rate of renewable energy and the complex island environment, being confronted with many challenges in the whole life cycle. To implement the project smoothly and make full use of the advantages of renewable energy-based island microgrids, a risk assessment must be incorporated. In this study, based on a three-dimensional model, we take a holistic view of identifying risks that includes four categories (technical, economic, environmental and social aspects). Later, a reasonable and applicable risk assessment framework is constructed, in which the fuzziness and randomness of information are taken into consideration. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is used to endow the index evaluation information, and the cloud model is used to transform the evaluation information. The final results show that the overall risk level of China's island microgrids is ``Slightly High'', particularly in the technical aspect. Furthermore, corresponding mitigation strategies are put forward. This study conducts a comprehensive study on the risk assessment and risk response measures of island microgrids, which is conducive to deal with potential risks, thereby to minimize the loss and promote the island microgrid development.},

	abstract = {With the rapid emerging of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the proliferation of cloud-based applications, the cloud computing industry is becoming a vital element for ensuring our daily services. However, cloud computing uses large scale data centers equipped with energy-hungry servers and huge power facilities that massively consume power. This presents a real challenge which can negatively influence the power grid, while exposing the environment to global warming issues. Therefore, minimizing cloud data center power consumption is a challenging problem and has to be addressed. In this paper, we look at renewable energy in the context of a smart grid--cloud architecture and investigate the issue of grid power dispatching to cloud data centers. Since cloud data centers have a non-cooperative nature regarding power demand from the power stations, we model our power allocation problem as a non-cooperative game. Afterwards, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we formulate the payoff function of our game as a non-linear optimization problem before resolving it using Lagrange multipliers and Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions. Thus, we determine the assigned optimal quantity to each data center based on three main criteria : renewable energy usage, number of critical running applications and workload charge. Extensive simulations are performed by comparing our scheme with an existing work. Results show that our scheme outperforms the comparing approach with a percentage of 31.2% in terms of power load rate and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide.},

The evaluation of regional energy internet is a significant way to measure the development level of regional energy internet. However, such work is a blank of current research. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate regional energy network from a comprehensive view. Firstly, this study establishes an evaluation criteria system for regional energy internet, which consists of four dimensions (technical, economic, social, and engineering) and associated 16 criteria. Secondly, considering the uncertainty involved the evaluation process, cloud model is utilized to depict the fuzziness and randomness, which are indispensable elements in the uncertainty. Thirdly, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, which is a combination of AHP and fuzzy set theory, is developed to determine the weights of the identified dimensions and criteria. Finally, the evaluation results in practical case in China show that the comprehensive evaluation grade of the demonstration project is good. And the technical dimension and economic dimension should be noted, mainly involving comprehensive efficiency and energy economy level. The results of the evaluation are exactly consistent with the actual situation, indicating that the evaluation method has strong practical value.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of networking technologies resulted in the execution of an extensive data-centric task, which needs the critical quality of service by cloud data centers. The task scheduling problem is difficult to attain an optimal solution, so we use the Squirrel Search Algorithm to approximate the optimal solution. Traditional scheduling algorithms attempt to reduce execution time without taking into account the energetic cost and security issues. In this scheme, a fuzzy-based task scheduling (SAEA) algorithm is developed which closely combines energy cost, makespan, degree of imbalance, and security levels for multi-objective optimization scheduling problems. In addition, SAEA tries to find a high-quality knowledge base that accurately describes the fuzzy system by parallel squirrels search algorithm (PSSA). The automatic design of a fuzzy rule-based system is currently attracting the interest due to the inherently dynamic nature and the typical complex search spaces of cloud. Extensive experiments prove that SAEA algorithm obtains superior performances in energy cost around 45% compared with MGA and has a better result in terms of total execution time, makespan, degree of imbalance, and security value than other similar scheduling algorithms under high load condition.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a multi-energy system optimisation software, ``Sustainable Energy Management System'' (SEMS), developed as part of a Siemens, Greater London Authority and Royal Borough of Greenwich partnership in collaboration with the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University and Imperial College London. The software was developed for application at a social housing estate in Greenwich, London, as part of the Borough's efforts to retrofit the energy systems and building fabric of its housing stock. Its purpose is to balance energy across vectors and networks through day-ahead forecasting and optimisations that can be interpreted as control outputs for energy plant such as a water source heat pump, district heating pumps and values, power switchgear, gas boilers, a thermal store, electric vehicle chargers and a photovoltaic array. The optimisation objectives are to minimise greenhouse gas emissions and operational cost. The tool uses Hypernetwork Theory based orchestration coupled with a microservice architecture. The distributed nature of the design ensures flexibility and scalability. Currently, microservices have been programmed to forecast domestic heating demand, domestic electricity demand, electric vehicle demand, solar photovoltaic generation, ground temperature, and to run a day-ahead energy balance optimisation. This paper presents the results from both domestic heat and electricity demand forecasting, as well as the overall design and integration of the software with a physical system. The works build on that of O'Dwyer, et al. (2020) who developed a preliminary energy management software and digital twin. Their work acts as a foundation for this real-world commercialisation-ready program that integrates with physical assets.},

@article{MOGHADDAM2021142,
	abstract = {Cloud service providers use load balancing algorithms in order to avoid Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) and wasted energy consumption due to host over- and under-utilization, respectively. Load balancing algorithms migrate VMs between hosts in order to balance host loads. Any Virtual Machines (VMs) that are migrated experience performance degradation which results in lower Quality of Service (QoS) and can possibly result in SLAVs. Hence, an optimal load balancing method should reduce the number of over- and under-utilized hosts with a minimal number of VM migrations. One of the metrics used previously in the literature for evaluating load balancing stated that it equally considered SLAVs caused by both over-utilized hosts and migrations. However, in this paper, we show that, in fact, this metric values keeping the number of migrations low at the expense of an increased number of over-utilized hosts. This disparity is demonstrated by simulation of Google, PlanetLab and Azure data sets in CloudSim. This metric may suit public cloud providers which are focused on minimizing SLAVs and keeping energy costs low, but does not consider the QoS of customer VMs. We propose an alternative metric that considers QoS for the VMs. This alternative metric considers not only performance loss during migration, but also performance degradation due to host over-utilization. Private cloud providers, e.g., IT services within large organizations, often value the performance of their ``customer'' VMs, i.e., the QoS their organization receives, as well as traditional cloud provider costs, i.e., energy and SLAV costs. Hence, our alternative metric would be more appropriate in these scenarios. We compare and contrast load balancing methods using both the existing, biased metric and our new alternative metric.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is one of the successful computing paradigms and it has contributed to the huge growth of the IT industry as well as individual usability of computing resource due to its ease of accessing resource properties. Moreover, cloud computing emergence has another advantage for deployment in a large scientific workflow. The scientific workflow defines a computation series which enables data analysis in a distributed and structured manner; since this workflow possesses a huge amount of task, energy consumption is a primary issue. In this research work, we have designed an efficient mechanism named EAPT (Energy-Aware Parameter tuning) to minimize energy consumption; in here two eminent parameter such as computation parameter, communication parameter and task size are tuned for optimizing these parameters resulting in minimization in energy. Further EAPT achieves the energy minimization through balancing the load dynamically, through tuning the above discussed parameter. EAPT tunes this in efficient way such that load are distributed based upon resources. EAPT is evaluated by considering the energy consumption as a parameter and varying the number of VM as 20, 40 and 60; moreover, a comparative analysis is carried out with the existing DVFS model. Comparative analysis shows that EAPT consumes marginally less energy than the existing model.},

	abstract = {Virtual machine (VM) placement is a key technique for energy optimization in cloud data centers. Previous work generally focus on how to place the VMs efficiently in servers to optimize the physical resources used (e.g., memory, bandwidth, CPU, etc.), network resources used or cooling energy consumption. These work can optimize the energy consumption of cloud data centers according to one or two aspects (e.g. server, network or cooling), however, these methods may cause increased energy consumption in other aspects. To address this problem, we propose a global-energy-aware VMP (virtual machine placement) strategy to reduce, from multiple aspects, the total energy consumption of data centers. A two-step SAG algorithm is designed to lower the energy consumption of cloud data centers where multiple VMs are deployed. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SAG. Two workloads from real-world data centers are utilized to quantitatively measure and compare the performance of our SAG with other typical algorithms. Experimental results indicate that, compared to other algorithms, our global-energy-aware VMP strategy can reduce the total energy consumption of the cloud data center by 8%--24.9%.},

	abstract = {In major Information Technology (IT) companies such as Google, Rackspace and Amazon Web Services (AWS), virtualization and containerization technologies are usually used to execute customers' workloads and applications --- as part of their cloud computing services offering. The computational resources are provided through large-scale datacentres, which consume substantial amount of energy and, consequently, affect our environment with global warming. Cloud datacentres have become a backbone for today's business and economy, which are the fastest-growing electricity consumers, globally. Numerous studies suggest that ∼30% of the US datacentres are comatose and the others are grossly less-utilized, which make it possible to save energy through technologies like virtualization and containerization. These technologies provide support for allocation and consolidation of workloads on appropriate resources. However, consolidation comprises migrations of virtual machines (VMs), containers and/or applications, depending on the underlying virtualization method; that are expensive in terms of energy consumption, performance degradation, and therefore, costs which is mostly not accounted for in many existing models, and, possibly, it could be more energy and performance efficient not to consolidate. This paper describes energy consumption and performance, therefore, cost issues of large-scale datacentres. Besides, we cover various methods for energy and performance efficient distributed systems, clouds and datacentres. We elaborate energy efficiency methods at three different levels: hardware; resource management; and applications. Besides these, different performance management techniques are mapped onto taxonomies and described in details. In last, energy, performance and cost management techniques, at geographically distributed and multi-access edge computing platforms, are described along with critical discussion.},

	abstract = {Storage technology has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for processing various applications in cloud data centers. The storage infrastructure consisting of Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) accounts for high energy consumption. Also, the trade-offs between HDDs and SSDs in terms of cost and energy consumption are extremely high. Therefore, disk-based storage subsystems need to be more energy efficient. This paper proposes an intelligent energy-efficient hybrid disk storage system. The proposed system recognizes the frequently used data from traces of applications. Replica management along with data layout is used to allocate frequently used files in hot disks and the other files in cold disks. The request is executed using an intelligent scheduling technique that searches and selects the disk based on its states. The scheduling technique selects either an idle or active disk without spinning the standby disks. The selection procedure also considers minimum waiting time for the active disk and maximum remaining idle time for the idle disk. The proposed system has been implemented by adding disk management in the cloud environment, which proved to be highly effective in achieving a 39% power savings with an 18.26% decrease in execution time.},

	abstract = {One of the significant limitations in the evaluation of hybrid clouds is the difficulty in validating new solutions by their deployment in real systems since replication of tests on large environments is usually highly expensive. To overcome these limitations, simulators have become popular for conducting preliminary tests. However, there is still a lack of simulation tools with easy-to-use code that allows handling diverse cloud scenarios and the simulation of energy consumption of all devices (hosts, switches, routers, and storage). To fill this gap, the simulator SinergyCloud has been developed to evaluate data centers in hybrid clouds. SinergyCloud allows evaluating diverse cloud scenarios, including energy consumption, workflow makespan, the completion time of tasks, and migrations of virtual machines, with a fine granularity of abstraction. SinergyCloud can handle the simulation of hybrid clouds with multiple data centers composed of hundreds of thousands of devices. Moreover, it is a Java-based, event-driven, and packet-level simulator, having a less steep learning curve than do other simulators. To show the feasibility of SinergyCloud, we performed accuracy and scalability analyses. Metrics values obtained by another simulator had less than 1% difference compared to SinergyCloud, demonstrating its accuracy. In terms of scalability, a scenario with 10,000 hosts was simulated in about 7 h using a typical personal computer. A comprehensive analysis of algorithms for the scheduling of virtual machines in a hybrid cloud is also presented, showing how to perform various evaluations.},

	abstract = {To meet the ever-increasing requirements of cloud users, cloud service providers have further increased the deployment of cloud data centers. Cloud users can freely choose the cloud data center that suits them according to their own business characteristics and budget expenditures. This requires cloud service providers to continuously improve service quality and reduce usage costs to expand their own user base. Mature cloud service providers will continuously optimize cloud tasks and virtual machine deployment methods to increase physical machine utilization and reduce cloud data center energy consumption. However, existing virtual machine deployment algorithms usually have low utilization of physical machines or high energy consumption of cloud data centers, thereby reducing the frequency of use by cloud users and the benefits of cloud service providers. This paper systematically analyzes virtual machine and physical machine models. At the same time, the K-means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning and the KNN classification algorithm for supervised learning are expanded to establish a dynamic hybrid resource deployment rule. Then, an energy-aware resource deployment algorithm for cloud data centers based on dynamic hybrid machine learning (EHML) is proposed based on the theory of machine learning. This algorithm reduces energy consumption by increasing the average utilization of physical machines. Finally, the experimental test results show that the average utilization of physical machines and energy consumption of the algorithm are significantly better than those of the comparison algorithms.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of cloud computing in the last decade has led to an increasing concern about the energy requirement of cloud data centers. Dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation is an effective way to tackle this issue, where VMs are executed on as few physical machines (PMs) as possible. Meanwhile, VM placement must be performed strategically, by considering different factors of the available resources to optimal exploitation of them. Moreover, a major challenge is the system's reliability degradation because of the high frequency of consolidation and placing VMs on unreliable PMs. In this paper, we address the problem by introducing a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model to predict future resource usage. Using the DTMC model along with the reliability model of PMs leads to more accurate PMs categorization based on their status. Then, a multi-objective VM placement approach is proposed to achieve the optimal VMs to PMs mapping using the ε-dominance-based multi-objective artificial bee colony (ε-MOABC) algorithm which can efficiently balance the overall energy consumption, resource wastage, and the system reliability to meet SLA and QoS requirements. We have validated the effectiveness of our proposed approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. Competitive analysis of the experimental results demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly improves energy consumption while avoiding the inefficient VM migrations.},

	abstract = {The smart applications dominating the planet in the present day and age, have innovatively progressed to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) based systems and related infrastructures in all spectrums of life. Since, variety of applications are being developed using this IoT paradigm, there is an immense necessity for storing data, processing them to get meaningful information and render suitable services to the end-users. The ``thing'' in this decade is not only a smart sensor or a device; it can be any physical or household object, a smart device or a mobile. With the ever increasing rise in population and smart device usage in every sphere of life, when all of such ``thing''s generates data, there is a chance of huge data traffic in the internet. This could be handled only by integrating ``Internet of Everything (IoE)'' paradigm with a completely diversified technology --- Cloud Computing. In order to handle this heavy flow of data traffic and process the same to generate meaningful information, various services in the global environment are utilized. Hence the primary focus revolves in integrating these two diversified paradigm shifts to develop intelligent information processing systems. Energy Efficient Cloud Based Internet of Everything (EECloudIoE) architecture is proposed in this study, which acts as an initial step in integrating these two wide areas thereby providing valuable services to the end users. The utilization of energy is optimized by clustering the various IoT network using Wind Driven Optimization Algorithm. Next, an optimized Cluster Head (CH) is chosen for each cluster, using Firefly Algorithm resulting in reduced data traffic in comparison to other non-clustering schemes. The proposed clustering of IoE is further compared with the widely used state of the art techniques like Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Gravitational Search algorithm (AGSA). The results justify the superiority of the proposed methodology outperforming the existing approaches with an increased life-time and reduction in traffic.},

	abstract = {The continuous advancement of cloud computing technology has driven the vigorous development of cloud data centers. This manifests itself not only in increasing numbers, but also in rapid expansion scale. At the same time, the problems of high energy consumption, high cost and high carbon emissions began to stand out. These factors have become a bottleneck restricting the further development of cloud computing technology. As a result of the application of virtualization technology, mature cloud service providers use virtual machines instead of physical machines to provide users with computing, storage and other services. Therefore, the scheduling algorithm of cloud tasks and virtual machines has been widely studied by academia as a core problem. However, most of the current cloud data center resource management algorithms take CPU utilization as the main consideration, and increase the CPU utilization through virtual machine integration to reduce the energy consumption of cloud data centers. However, these algorithms will cause waste and low utilization of other resources in the cloud data center due to excessive consideration of CPU utilization. This paper systematically analyzes the mapping relationship between cloud tasks, virtual machines and physical machines. At the same time, the performance of cloud tasks, virtual machines, and physical machines is modeled in the cloud data center. By comprehensively considering the CPU and memory characteristics of cloud tasks, the memory priority cloud task mapping rule is established. Based on the rule, the memory-aware resource management algorithm for low-energy cloud data centers (MALE) is proposed. The algorithm maps cloud tasks and deploys virtual machines according to the memory requirements of the cloud tasks, thereby achieving the goal of simultaneously reducing the total fee of cloud users and the energy consumption of cloud data centers. Finally, the algorithm is compared with the other three algorithms. The experimental simulation results show that the effect of the proposed algorithm in this paper is significantly better than the comparison algorithm for the total fee of cloud users and the energy consumption of the cloud data center.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous Computing Systems (HCS) have received widespread attention due to their powerful computing power, low cost, and high scalability. In HCS ranging from small-embedded devices to large data centers, energy consumption is one of the crucial design constraints. Meanwhile, the schedule length (response time) of parallel applications directly affects their Quality of Service (QoS) experience. In this study, we address the problem of minimizing the schedule length of energy-constrained parallel applications (MSLEC) on heterogeneous computing systems. Firstly, we define the concept of task energy demand rate and energy allocation factor to reasonably allocate the allocatable energy. Secondly, We propose a two-stage hybrid energy allocation (HEA) strategy and divide the allocatable energy into two parts according to the energy allocation factor, namely static pre-allocate energy (SAE) and dynamic pre-allocate energy (DAE). In the first stage, we pre-allocate SAE for each task based on the minimum energy demand and energy demand rate before task scheduling. In the second stage, we dynamically allocate DAE to each task during the operation of the scheduling algorithm. Thirdly, We conduct a rigorous mathematical proof of the feasibility of the proposed strategy. Finally, according to the proposed strategy, we design a novel HEA-based parallel application scheduling (HEA-PAS) algorithm, which aims to solve the MSLEC problem. Experiments on real-world and randomly generated parallel applications show that the proposed HEA-PAS algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness.},

@article{CARREGA2020107210,
	abstract = {Efficient usage of IT equipment in Data Centers requires modulating their power-consumption according to the actual workload. The most effective strategy to this aim consists in consolidating as many applications as possible on the smallest number of servers, so that idle devices can be shut down or put in low-power states. Usually, this process is driven by computing and networking resources requested by each application (e.g., CPU and RAM) and applies a certain degree of overcommitment, assuming that such resources are not fully used continuously. However, this approach is critical with real workload patterns, which usually change over time; as a matter of fact, consolidation in real scenarios often leads to either low efficiency or violations of Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, depending on the level of overcommitment. In this paper, we investigate a novel consolidation strategy based on an enhanced system model for the Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud paradigm, which targets a better trade-off between Energy Efficiency and Quality of Service. We explicitly target modular cloud applications, which design is split into multiple components deployed in Virtual Machine (VM)s or containers. Our consolidation strategy allows to ``freeze'' parts of the application which are not currently used, making them available when requested with minimal latency. This improves energy saving with respect to other approaches, especially when idle VMs are present for backup or redundancy purposes, without degrading the service level. We compare multiple heuristics available in Optaplanner to solve our consolidation problem, and investigate improvements with respect to a more traditional approach. Our evaluation includes both simulations and experimentation in a real test-bed. The comparison shows that the Late Acceptance algorithm on average finds better solutions than other alternatives and energy efficiency improves up to 40% with respect to more conventional strategies, with deterioration of QoS indexes below 1%.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing platform has emerged to be a promising computing paradigm of recent time. Various applications from different domains having rigid deadline constraints are deployed in the cloud system for their respective benefits. Energy-efficient execution of these applications, meeting their deadline constraints is a challenge. Most of the existing research on the energy-efficient scheduling of these applications in the cloud domain consider a linear relationship between the energy consumption and the resource utilization of the system, and they focus on maximizing the utilization of resources to reduce the active number of computing nodes to minimize energy consumption. In this paper, we first devise a power consumption model for the cloud system which considers both the static and dynamic components of it and assumes a nonlinear relationship with utilization. Then we introduce the concept of urgent points in case of tasks having deadline in the context of a heterogeneous cloud computing environment. Then we propose two energy-efficient scheduling approaches, named UPS and UPS-ES designed based on the urgent points of the tasks and two threshold values of the host utilization. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted both for synthetic tasksets and Google cloud tracelogs. The results are compared with a state of the art scheduling policy and found that our policies perform significantly better than them, with an energy reduction of up to 42% while the deadline constraints of all the tasks are met.},

	abstract = {Software is a fundamental part of today's society. However, both users and software professionals need to be aware that its use impacts on the environment, due to the high energy consumption it entails. One of the main gaps to be faced is the difficulty of analyzing software energy consumption in the endeavor to know whether a particular software product is as much energetically efficient as possible, or at least more efficient than another, and to improve the environmental objectives of the software. For this reason, a Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve eNviromental Goals of the Software (FEETINGS) is presented in this paper. FEETINGS is composed of three main components: an ontology to provide precise definitions and harmonize the terminology related to software energy measurement; a process to guide researchers in carrying out the energy consumption measurements of the software, and a technological environment, which allows the capture, analysis and interpretation of software energy consumption data. This paper also presents an example of the application of the FEETINGS, which aims to raise awareness of the energy consumed by the software in activities that we perform daily, such as writing a tweet or a Facebook post. As a result, we have been able to verify that FEETINGS allows us to carry out an analysis and measurement of software energy consumption to provide users with good practices, as using an emoji or a picture rather than a GIF. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science.

	abstract = {The growing deployment of Internet services in cloud data centers significantly increases the grid energy cost of cloud providers. Considering the environmental effect, many of current cloud providers migrate to green cloud data centers (GCDCs), and seek to reduce the usage of brown energy by partially (or entirely) adopting renewable energy sources. However, the temporal diversity in the grid price, wind speed and solar irradiance makes it a big challenge to minimize the grid energy cost of a GCDC while meeting the performance of each delay bounded request. This work proposes a Temporal Request Scheduling algorithm (TRS) that jointly considers the temporal diversity. TRS considers the long tail in real-life requests' delay, and can provide strict delay assurance to all arriving requests by scheduling them to execute within their delay bound. Besides, this work explicitly provides mathematical modeling of the relation between the service rate in a GCDC and the refusal of delay bounded requests. Specifically, TRS solves a constrained nonlinear optimization problem by a hybrid meta-heuristic in each of its iterations. Compared with some existing scheduling methods, TRS can achieve higher throughput and lower grid energy cost for a GCDC while meeting each request's delay requirement.},

The SLAs are composed of different quality of service (QoS) rules promised by the provider. Thus, the QoS in Clouds becomes more and more important. Precise definitions and metrics have to be explained. This article proposes an overview of Cloud QoS parameters as well as their classification, but also it defines usable metrics to evaluate QoS parameters. Moreover, the defined QoS metrics are measurable and reusable in any scheduling approach for Clouds. The use of these QoS models is done through the performance analysis of three scheduling approaches considering four QoS parameters. In addition to the energy consumption and the Response Time, two other QoS parameters are taken into account in different virtual machines scheduling approaches. These parameters are dynamism and robustness, which are usually not easily measurable. The evaluation is done through simulations, using two common scheduling algorithms and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for virtual machines (VMs) reallocation, allowing us to analyze the QoS parameters evolution in time. Simulation results have shown that including various and antagonist QoS parameters allows a deeper analysis of the intrinsic behavior and insight of these three algorithms. Also, it is shown that the multi-objective optimization allows the service provider to seek the best trade-off between service performances and end user's experience.},

An appropriate test suite focusing on the parts of the cloud to be tested must be efficiently synthesised and executed, while the correctness of the test results must be checked. Additionally, alternative cloud configurations that optimise the energetic consumption of the cloud must be generated and analysed accordingly, which is challenging. To solve these issues we present MT-EA4Cloud, a formal approach to check the correctness -- from an energy-aware point of view -- of cloud systems and optimise their energy consumption. To make the checking of energy consumption practical, MT-EA4Cloud combines metamorphic testing, evolutionary algorithms and simulation. Metamorphic testing allows to formally model the underlying cloud infrastructure in the form of metamorphic relations. We use metamorphic testing to alleviate both the reliable test set problem, generating appropriate test suites focused on the features reflected in the metamorphic relations, and the oracle problem, using the metamorphic relations to check the generated results automatically. MT-EA4Cloud uses evolutionary algorithms to efficiently guide the search for optimising the energetic consumption of cloud systems, which can be calculated using different cloud simulators.},

	abstract = {Datacenters are the principal electricity consumers for cloud computing that provide an IT backbone for today's business and economy. Numerous studies suggest that most of the servers, in the US datacenters, are idle or less-utilised, making it possible to save energy by using resource consolidation techniques. However, consolidation involves migrations of virtual machines, containers and/or applications, depending on the underlying virtualisation method; that can be expensive in terms of energy consumption and performance loss. In this paper, we: (a) propose a consolidation algorithm which favours the most effective migration among VMs, containers and applications; and (b) investigate how migration decisions should be made to save energy without any negative impact on the service performance. We demonstrate through a number of experiments, using the real workload traces for 800 hosts, approximately 1516 VMs, and more than million containers, how different approaches to migration, will impact on datacenter's energy consumption and performance. We suggest, using reasonable assumptions for datacenter set-up, that there is a trade-off involved between migrating containers and virtual machines. It is more performance efficient to migrate virtual machines; however, migrating containers could be more energy efficient than virtual machines. Moreover, migrating containerised applications, that run inside virtual machines, could lead to energy and performance efficient consolidation technique in large-scale datacenters. Our evaluation suggests that migrating applications could be ~5.5% more energy efficient and ~11.9% more performance efficient than VMs migration. Further, energy and performance efficient consolidation is ~14.6% energy and ~7.9% performance efficient than application migration. Finally, we generalise our results using several repeatable experiments over various workloads, resources and datacenter set-ups.},

	abstract = {The fast growth in demand for utility-based IT services has lead to the formation of large scale Cloud data centers. The electrical energy consumption of these data centers results in high operational costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Cloud data centers benefit from the use of virtualization technology to reduce their energy consumption. This technology enables a Cloud data center to allocate its physical resources (CPU, memory, hard disk, network bandwidth) on demand and balance loads between their physical hosts by live migration of Virtual Machines (VMs). However, the migration of VMs can result in Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) and consequently low Quality of Service (QoS). Hence, in this paper, we propose an energy aware VM consolidation algorithm that minimizes SLAVs. Dynamic VM consolidation has three stages: a) Detecting over- and under-utilized hosts; b) Selecting one or more VMs for migration from those hosts; c) Finding destination hosts for the selected VMs. Therefore, the proposed VM consolidation algorithm contains different models for each stage. For the first stage, we developed different fine-tuned Machine Learning (ML) prediction models for individual VMs to predict the best time to trigger migrations from hosts. For the second stage, we lexicographically consider migration time and host CPU usage when selecting VMs to migrate. Finally, a new method based on the Best Fit Decreasing (BFD) algorithm was developed to select a destination host for the VMs being migrated. Our algorithm was compared to a baseline VM consolidation algorithm that used Local Regression for detecting over-utilized hosts, minimum migration time for the VM selection stage and power-aware best fit for the host selection stage. The comparison demonstrated that our VM consolidation algorithm improved energy consumption and SLAVs by 26% and 50%, respectively.},

Server consolidation using virtualization technology is widely used to reduce the energy consumption rates of data centers. Efficient Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) plays an important role in server consolidation technology. VMP is an NP-hard problem for which optimal solutions are not possible, even for small-scale data centers. In this paper, a hybrid VMP algorithm is proposed based on another proposed improved permutation-based genetic algorithm and multidimensional resource-aware best fit allocation strategy. The proposed VMP algorithm aims to improve the energy consumption rate of cloud data centers through minimizing the number of active servers that host Virtual Machines (VMs). Additionally, the proposed VMP algorithm attempts to achieve balanced usage of the multidimensional resources (CPU, RAM, and Bandwidth) of active servers, which in turn, reduces resource wastage. The performance of both proposed algorithms are validated through intensive experiments. The obtained results show that the proposed improved permutation-based genetic algorithm outperforms several other permutation-based algorithms on two classical problems (the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem) using various standard datasets. Additionally, this study shows that the proposed hybrid VMP algorithm has promising energy saving and resource wastage performance compared to other heuristics and metaheuristics. Moreover, this study reveals that the proposed VMP algorithm achieves a balanced usage of the multidimensional resources of active servers while others cannot.},

	abstract = {Web data are experiencing a proliferation of video content for mobile platforms. This is accompanied by new advances in heterogeneous general purpose processor (GPP) cores embedded in mobile devices which offer a great opportunity to enhance both performance and energy efficiency of software (SW) video decoding. On the other hand, hardware (HW) video accelerators are more energy-efficient but are not flexible and their time-to-market is significant. In this context, this paper proposes a characterization methodology to investigate the performance and power consumption of two video decoding approaches on mobile platforms. The first one uses a HW decoder intellectual property (HDIP) in addition to a GPP (for the control). The second one is SW-based and uses only a heterogeneous multi-core GPP. The objective is to study the behavior of both video decoding approaches by comparing them and to understand why and in which case it is worth relying on the GPP rather than the HDIP. We also derive the optimal GPP configuration (number of cores and their frequency) that minimizes the energy consumption for a given video bit-stream on a given platform. The proposed methodology was applied on the HEVC video codec standard. In some state-of-the-art work figures, the SW video decoding consumes up to 1000× more energy than HDIPs. Our results show that, for video resolutions of 1080p and lower and at the operating system perspective point of view, the HEVC SW decoding consumes on average less than 4× more energy (mJ/Frame) than the HW one. Then, the more we scale up the resolution, the more we get the advantage of using the HW video decoding. Furthermore, the HEVC HW and SW decoders consume effectively less than 30% and 50% of the global power consumption of the tested platforms, respectively.},

It is widely accepted that the cost of the energy consumption in the environment is a dominant part of the owner's budget. However, when considering energy efficiency, VM scheduling decisions become more constrained, leading in the violation of job deadlines and hence compromising QoS. This paper studies energy efficient VM scheduling strategies in virtualized environments to minimize the queue time and makespan under the fulfillment of SLA requirements (i.e., deadline). Specifically, six energy efficient VM scheduling strategies are investigated incorporated with the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) power management technique. They consist of user-oriented and system-oriented policies. The strategies are extensively simulated and compared with three power management governing methods provided at hypervisor level (i.e., userspec, ondemand, and performance). To conduct simulation experiments, we employ real-world high performance computing (HPC) workloads collected from a production data center. For comparison and evaluation, we analyze the: (a) energy consumption, (b) runtime, (c) queue time, (d) makespan, and (e) slowdown ratio.

	abstract = {In the age of the information explosion, the energy demand for cloud data centers has increased markedly; hence, reducing the energy consumption of cloud data centers is essential. Dynamic virtual machine VM consolidation, as one of the effective methods for reducing energy energy consumption is extensively employed in large cloud data centers. It achieves the energy reductions by concentrating the workload of active hosts and switching idle hosts into low-power state; moreover, it improves the resource utilization of cloud data centers. However, the quality of service (QoS) guarantee is fundamental for maintaining dependable services between cloud providers and their customers in the cloud environment. Therefore, reducing the power costs while preserving the QoS guarantee are considered as the two main goals of this study. To efficiently address this problem, the proposed VM consolidation approach considers the current and future utilization of resources through the host overload detection (UP-POD) and host underload detection (UP-PUD). The future utilization of resources is accurately predicted using a Gray-Markov-based model. In the experiment, the proposed approach is applied for real-world workload traces in CloudSim and were compared with the existing benchmark algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches significantly reduce the number of VM migrations and energy consumption while maintaining the QoS guarantee.},

	abstract = {Context
It is essential to be aware of the energy efficiency of software when it is running, so that it can be improved; to that end, energy consumption measurements need to be carried out. To ensure that these measurements are as reliable as possible, it is recommended that a well-defined process be followed.
Objective
To identify how the process for analysing the energy efficiency of software should be carried out (including the definition of the software to be evaluated, the selection of measuring instruments, the analysis and the presentation of results, etc.), in an endeavour to improve the reliability and consistency of the information obtained regarding energy efficiency.
Method
An analysis of related work was carried out, to extract some good practices in measuring energy consumption; based on our experience, a process to analyse the energy efficiency of the software has been defined.
Results
We have defined a process to analyse the energy efficiency of the software. We describe this process through a set of phases that covers all the steps needed to carry out a correct analysis of the energy consumption of the software executed. Moreover, this process was validated with two different studies using different measurement instruments (one with a hardware-based approach and one with a software-based approach) to ensure its applicability to all types of studies with software energy consumption measurement.
Conclusion
The steps to be followed to analyse the energy efficiency of the software need to be established. A new process has hence been defined to improve the reliability and consistency of the measurements. Furthermore, this process facilitates the replicability and comparison of the studies carried out.},

	abstract = {The energy consumption is one of the major concerns addressed by recent researches in the green cloud environment. As a result, to decrease the enormous increase in energy consumption, one of the most promising scheduling techniques used nowadays is the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technique. DVFS reduces energy consumption by lowering the processors' frequency for virtual machines (VMs); this results in an increase in the occurrence of errors during the execution of the workflow, which decreases the reliability of the system. As a consequence, this paper addresses the DVFS problem by proposing a new Smart Energy and Reliability Aware Scheduling algorithm (SERAS) for workflow execution in the cloud environment. The SERAS approach split the target deadline of workflow across tasks. Afterward, the proposed algorithm decreases the frequency of processors for VMs using the DVFS technique without missing the tasks' deadline. As a consequence, the SERAS algorithm allocates the tasks to the most appropriate VMs with suitable frequencies levels while guaranteeing both the reliability and the completion time requirement of green cloud systems. To vindicate the effectiveness of the SERAS algorithm in real-world applications, we carried out a series of experiments on four real workflows generated using a scientific toolkit. Also, we performed comprehensive experiments with recent researches. The results showed that the SERAS algorithm outperforms its competitors while keeping both the reliability and completion time requirements. Furthermore, the estimated time complexity and average execution time show the applicability of the SERAS algorithm compared with their competitors.},

The gross occupied resource weight ratio is defined as the ratio of the sum of resource weights of all virtual machines over the sum of available resource weights of all running physical machines. When the gross occupied resource weight ratio is greater than the maximum tolerant occupied resource weight ratio, preset to ensure quality of service, a standby physical machine in the non-running physical machines is selected and wakened up to join as one of the running physical machines. On the other hand, when the gross occupied resource weight ratio is less than the minimum critical occupied resource weight ratio, preset to trigger energy saving algorithms, one of the running physical machines, selected as a migration physical machine with the virtual machines therein removed after live migration, is moved from other running physical machines, and then turned off. As a result, a resource allocation process is realized to distribute loads of the running physical machines such that the total number of the running physical machines can be flexibly dispatched to achieve the objective of green power management.},

	abstract = {Monolithic applications are a subject that includes several knowledge areas. Sometimes it can be a challenge to optimize CPU or IO requirements because it is not trivial to recognize the problem itself and improve it. There are many approaches to resolve this situation, where a trending one is the microservices. As a variant of the service-oriented architecture, microservices is a technique that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. This decomposition enables better software management in cloud-based environments since we can replicate each part individually using cloud elasticity to avoid execution bottlenecks. Also, since elasticity mitigates resource overprovisioning, it favors better energy consumption: the cloud owner can redistribute finite available resources among different tenants, and users can pay less to use the infrastructure. However, elasticity tuning is not trivial and depends on several factors, such as user experience, application architecture, and parameter modeling. Today, we observe a lack of initiatives in the literature that address both performance and energy perspectives to support the execution of microservices applications in the cloud. Concerning this context, this article introduces Elergy as a lightweight proactive elasticity model that provides resource reorganization for a cloud-based microservices application. Its differential approach appears in improving energy consumption by periodically handling the most appropriate amount of resources to execute an application while maintaining or yet improving the performance of CPU-bound applications. Elergy performs these functions proactively, in such a way of preventing future problems related to either resource under- or overprovisioning. The results showed energy consumption reduction and a competitive cost (application time x consumed resources) when comparing Elergy with a non-elastic scenario. Elergy obtained savings from 1.93% to 27.92% for energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Grid-connection of renewable energy microgrids (GCREM) is an important form of promoting the use of clean and renewable energy (RE). However, GCREM will bring huge risks to the power grid. Accurate evaluation and control of risks are critical to the development of GCREM. The existing research is not deep and comprehensive enough to make a reliable evaluation on the risks. The current study proposes a new evaluation framework based on the unit decomposition of the system of GCREM, and then builds a holistic fuzzy hierarchy-cloud assessment model for the risks. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) decomposes GCREM risks to each functional unit of the system, and clarifies the risk transmission between the units within the system; (2) improves the accuracy of weighting risk variables based on interval type-2 fuzzy method; (3) realizes the visibility of risk evaluation and a prior judgment on its effectiveness; (4) establishes a 5-dimensional risk evaluation system of GCREM for the first time, which achieved full coverage of risk variables without the overlap between dimensions. The empirical analyses show that our model can not only assess the overall risk level of GCREM, but also identify key risk sources.},

@article{SAMRIYA2022100746,
	abstract = {Recent technologies and innovations have encouraged users to adopt cloud-based environment. Network intrusion detection (NID) is an important method for network system administrators to detect various security holes. The performance of traditional NID methods can be affected when unknown or new attacks are detected. For instance, existing intrusion detection systems may have overfitting, low classification accuracy, and high false positive rate (FPR) when faced with significantly large volume and variety of network data. For that reason, this system has been agreed by many establishments to allure the users with its suitable features. Because of its design, it is exposed to malicious attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to handle these issues which can detect such attacks accurately in a cloud environment. To analyze the IDS datasets some of the predominant choices are Deep learning and Machine learning (ML) algorithms. By adopting nature-inspired algorithms, the problems concerning the data quality and the usage of high-dimensional data can be managed. In this study the datasets KDD Cup 99 and NSL-KDD are used. The dataset is cleaned using the min-max normalization technique and it is processed using the 1-N encoding approach for achieving homogeneity. Dimensionality reduction is done using the Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and further processing is done using the deep neural network (DNN). To minimize the energy consumption we have adopted the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) mechanism to the system. The main reason to set up this concept is to develop a balance between the energy consumption and the time of different modes of VMs or hosts. The proposed model is validated and compared with ACO and Principal component analysis (PCA)-based (Na{\"\i}ve Bayes) NB models, the experimental outcomes proved the superiority of the ACO-DNN model over the existing methods.},

@article{BAI2022205,
	abstract = {With the development of cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other next generation information technologies, the scale of the data center industry worldwide is growing rapidly, resulting in a sharp increase in energy consumption. In order to efficiently reduce the idle energy consumption in cloud data centers, in this paper, we propose an energy-saving strategy based on two-threshold hysteresis cluster scheduling mechanism, which enables the reserved cluster to be dynamically switched on and off with load variation. In addition, the tasks to be processed are classified into real-time tasks and non-real-time tasks. To keep track of the two classes of tasks and model the correlated traffic in cloud data centers, we describe the arrival flow of tasks as a Marked Markovian Arrival Process (MMAP). Accordingly, we develop a non-preemptive priority queue as the system model to capture the working principle of the proposed strategy. By using the matrix-geometric solution and Gauss--Seidel method, the steady-state distribution of the system model is analyzed, and some key Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) metrics are calculated. Results of numerical experiments show that, under the proposed energy-saving strategy, the overall power consumption in a small cloud data center can be reduced by an average of 30.20% under different scenarios, and the larger the cloud data center scale, the more obvious the energy saving effect. The results also confirm the impact of inter-class correlations of the input process on performance metrics. Furthermore, we identify the Pareto optimal solutions for trading off the overall power consumption and average waiting time of real-time tasks.},

	abstract = {The tremendous growth of cloud-based data centres leads to significant amount of energy. Thus, the prime concern for the cloud service providers is to generate environment friendly solution by minimizing the energy consumption. Further, due to increased demand of scientific workflow applications, cloud providers face a challenging issue of efficient workflow scheduling by minimizing the makespan. To address the above-mentioned contradictory issues, we proposed a Pareto based multi-objective discrete ant lion optimization algorithm (PBMO-DALO) to solve workflow-scheduling problem in cloud data centres with minimizing the conflicting objectives of makespan and energy consumption simultaneously. Distinguished from the original ant lion optimization algorithm, the proposed algorithm involves new encoding scheme for ants and antlions, their random walk and selection of fitter antlion for trap building to address the discrete nature of the workflow scheduling problem. Subsequently, the PBMO-DALO uses the Pareto dominance and crowding distance approach to tackle optimization of multiple objectives and to achieve the optimal solutions. The simulation results indicate that the proposed PBMO-DALO algorithm overwhelms other competing algorithms and generates good trade-off solutions with better convergence and uniform diversity.},

The pervasive adoption of cloud computing in smart cities' services and applications requires timely execution of tasks adhering to Quality of Services (QoS).

Maximizing the performance and minimizing the energy in the cloud data center is challenging. In this paper, we propose a performance and energy optimization bi-objective algorithm to trade off the contradicting performance and energy objectives. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is for the first time proposed using system performance counters. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a realistic cloud dataset in a cloud computing environment. Our experimental results achieve higher performance and lower energy consumption compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new conceptual approach to green data centers through the use of multiple, distributed networked data centers that are co-located with renewable energy. While green data centers are a well-established objective, conventional approaches have focused on either high efficiencies and/or the use of renewable energy. This model extends and innovates both approaches with three key design aspects. First, it emphasizes the use of many small, geographically distributed mini data centers. Second, such data centers can operate with the option of being dislocated from the electrical grid via a mini-grid, or behind the meter. Third, the approach enhances the use of renewable energy via the ability to transfer computing load from one mini data center to another as renewable supply or market contexts dictate. This paper introduces the conceptual approach, outlines the research broadly, and examines potential technical, economic, and policy constraints for the establishment of this approach on a broad scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the developing world, particularly in areas without substantial electricity transmission infrastructure.},

It is an enabling technological advancement towards green computing in Internet of things (IoT) eventually supporting sensor generated big data processing for smart cities. Related literature on energy efficiency in sensor enabled wireless network environments focuses on one aspect either energy oriented path selection or energy oriented message scheduling. The definition of path also varies in literature without considering links towards energy efficiency. In this context, this paper proposes an energy oriented path selection and message scheduling framework for sensor enabled wireless network environments. The technical novelty focuses on effective cooperation between path selection and message scheduling considering links on path, location of message sender, and number of processor in sensor towards energy efficiency. Specifically, a path selection strategy is developed based on shortest path and less number of links on path (SPLL). The location of message sender, and number of processor in specific sensor are utilized for developing a longer hops (LH) message scheduling approach. A system model is presented based on M/M/1 queuing analysis to showcase the effective cooperation of SPLL and LH towards energy efficiency. Simulation oriented comparative performance evaluation attest the energy efficiency of the proposed framework as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques considering number of energy oriented metrics.},

Therefore, the goal of the computer system design has been shifted to power and energy efficiency. To identify open challenges in the area and facilitate future advancements, it is essential to synthesize and classify the research on power- and energy-efficient design conducted to date. In this study, we discuss causes and problems of high power/energy consumption, and present a taxonomy of energy-efficient design of computing systems covering the hardware, operating system, virtualization, and data center levels. We survey various key works in the area and map them onto our taxonomy to guide future design and development efforts.

The job scheduler is needed by a cloud datacenter to arrange resources for executing jobs. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm for the cloud datacenter with a dynamic voltage frequency scaling technique. Our scheduling algorithm can efficiently increase resource utilization; hence, it can decrease the energy consumption for executing jobs. Experimental results show that our scheme can reduce more energy consumption than other schemes do. The performance of executing jobs is not sacrificed in our scheme.

In this paper, we explore energy saving opportunities of interface-based dynamic data structures. Our results suggest that savings opportunities exist in the C5 Collection between 16.95% and 97.50%. We propose a prototype and architecture for creating adaptive green data structures by applying machine learning tools to build a model for predicting energy efficient data structures based on the dynamic workload. Our neural network model can classify energy efficient data structures based on features such as the number of elements, frequency of operations, interface and set/bag semantics. The 10-fold cross validation result show 95.80% average accuracy of these predictions. Our n-gram model can accurately predict the most energy efficient data structure sequence in 19 simulated and real-world programs---on average, with more than 50% accuracy and up to 98% using a bigram predictor. Our GreenC5 prototype demonstrates how a green data structure can be implemented. With a simple decision making technique, the data structure can efficiently adapt for energy efficiency with low overhead.

	abstract = {Context
The energy efficiency of IT systems, also referred to as Green IT, is attracting more and more attention. While several researchers have focused on the energy efficiency of hardware and embedded systems, the role of application software in IT energy consumption still needs investigation.
Objective
This paper aims to define a methodology for measuring software energy efficiency and to understand the consequences of abstraction layers and application development environments for the energy efficiency of software applications.
Method
We first develop a measure of energy efficiency that is appropriate for software applications. We then examine how the use of application development environments relates to this measure of energy efficiency for a sample of 63 open source software applications.
Results
Our findings indicate that a greater use of application development environments -- specifically, frameworks and external libraries -- is more detrimental in terms of energy efficiency for larger applications than for smaller applications. We also find that different functional application types have distinctly different levels of energy efficiency, with text and image editing and gaming applications being the most energy inefficient due to their intense use of the processor.
Conclusion
We conclude that different designs can have a significant impact on the energy efficiency of software applications. We have related the use of software application development environments to software energy efficiency suggesting that there may be a trade-off between development efficiency and energy efficiency. We propose new research to further investigate this topic.},

Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact. In this paper, we define an architectural framework and principles for energy-efficient Cloud computing. Based on this architecture, we present our vision, open research challenges, and resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. The proposed energy-aware allocation heuristics provision data center resources to client applications in a way that improves energy efficiency of the data center, while delivering the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, in this paper we conduct a survey of research in energy-efficient computing and propose: (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering QoS expectations and power usage characteristics of the devices; and (c) a number of open research challenges, addressing which can bring substantial benefits to both resource providers and consumers. We have validated our approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant cost savings and demonstrates high potential for the improvement of energy efficiency under dynamic workload scenarios.},

	abstract = {The complex and multidisciplinary nature of environmental problems requires that they are dealt with in an integrated manner. This is a challenging task for which modelling and software have become key instruments used to promote sustainability and improve environmental decision processes. This role can especially be one that facilitates systematic integration of various knowledge and data, that fosters learning and helps to make predictions. This book presents the current state of the art in environmental modelling and software and identifies the future challenges in the field. This opening chapter provides an introduction to the topic, the objectives of the book and an outline of its chapters. Modelling can perform a range of valuable roles, from being a process of sharing and structuring knowledge to providing a means of investigating tradeoffs or increasing system understanding. Without full appreciation of their limitations and capabilities, however, there is a risk of models being misused or their outputs misinterpreted. On the other hand, model uncertainty cannot be totally eliminated but it can be understood, communicated and managed. The common problems in modelling that must be understood by modellers and users, and approaches to address them are discussed in the first few chapters. This section of chapters highlights the need for better standards in modelling practice, appropriate handling of uncertainty and improvement of model usability. The next section of the book explores generic and sectoral issues in modelling in the context of the state of the art in modelling tools and approaches, and thereby identifies future research, development and practice needs. Challenges pervasive in various modelling fields include the need for more credible and purposeful models, for better uncertainty management and for more support of an open and collaborative modelling process. Overall a much stronger emphasis on the modelling and software process is warranted.},

	abstract = {With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, green supplier selection as an indispensable part of green supply chain management has received extensive attention. Effective and reliable green supplier evaluation criteria are crucial to the success of green supplier selection. Therefore, identifying the critical criteria and determining the causality of these criteria is an important requirement of stakeholders. However, the existing approaches on identifying critical causal criteria suffer at least two weaknesses: firstly it assumes the same cognitive levels between different decision makers by using a pre-determined and uniformed formation to characterize evaluation judgements, which may cause potential decision bias; secondly there is a lack of effective methods to analyse and identify critical causal criteria in the face of heterogeneous judgements, potentially causing the duplication consideration of the impacts of some criteria in green supplier selection. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach integrating cloud model and DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) to determine critical causal criteria for green supplier evaluation with qualitative heterogeneous judgements. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, to address the difficulty in processing uncertain and heterogeneous judgements, the cloud model theory is utilized and further developed to convert heterogeneous qualitative judgements into homogeneous quantitative data with the form of interval integrated clouds, which realizes the flow of uncertainty from qualitative judgements to quantitative data. Second, to enable the identification of critical causal criteria, the DEMATEL method is extended to accommodate the cloud model environment to solve the identification problem. Third, a case study, followed by a comparison analysis is provided to illustrate the applicability and advantages of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can handle heterogeneous judgements effectively as well as that staff environmental training, green production innovation, green marketing and green corporate culture are the critical causal criteria for the given application.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the Green Internet of Things (G-IoT) has gained a lot of attention to developing energy-efficient communication systems. It consists of electronic devices and is integrated with numerous tight constraint sensors for observing the real world and provide communication services to end-users. However, optimal data collection and its management among the heterogeneous G-IoT objects are one of the main challenges. Many researchers are still proposing different solutions to cope with such problems and offering IoT-cloud paradigms for processing, storage, and scalability services. However, the data of smart cities is forwarded using the open-source IoT platform, and sensitive information may be compromised. Therefore, this research aims to propose a model of security measures using the Green Internet of Things with Cloud Integrated Data Management (M-SMDM) for Smart Cities. Firstly, it forms a long-run and energy-efficient connectivity using self-balancing trees and distributing load factors uniformly in green communication systems. Secondly, it addresses the problem of secret key distribution between peer nodes and attained trust for both partial and direct communication. In the end, it securing the transmission system from mobile gateways to application users against threats with improved overheads and data latency. The security analysis of the proposed M-SMDM model is done along with simulation-based experiments. The attained results disclose the importance of the proposed model in terms of network parameters compared to existing work.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has become an indispensable infrastructure that provides multi-granularity services to support large applications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), Cloud data centers have been built or extensively enlarged to cope with the growing computation and storage requirements of IIOT. The energy consumption of cloud data centers is dramatically increasing, which has created a lot of problems with greenhouse gas emissions and service costs. Server consolidation is a popular approach to reduce cloud data centers' energy consumption by minimizing the number of active physical machines. Most of the extant research has focused on server reduction in the consolidation process, but unbalanced resource utilization among different physical machines can cause the waste of physical resources. This paper proposes a resource-utilization-aware energy efficient server consolidation algorithm (RUAEE) that can be used to improve resource utilization while reducing the number of virtual machine live migrations. Experimental results show that RUAEE can reduce the energy consumption and service-level agreement (SLA) violation in cloud data center.},

	abstract = {This chapter considers the following fundamental scheduling problem. There are n deterministic jobs to be scheduled offline on multiple identical machines, which have bounded capacities. Each job is associated with a start-time, an end-time, a process time, and demand for machine capacity. The goal is to schedule all of the jobs nonpreemptively in their start-time--end-time windows, subject to machine capacity constraints such that the total busy time of the machines is minimized. We refer to this problem as minimizing the total busy time for the scheduling of multiple identical machines (MinTBT). This problem has important applications in power-aware scheduling for Cloud computing, optical network design, customer service systems, and other related areas. Scheduling to minimize busy time is already NP-hard in the special case in which all jobs have the same process time and can be scheduled in a fixed time interval. One best-known result for this problem is a 5-approximation algorithm for special instances using the first-fit-decreasing (FFD) algorithm. In this chapter, we propose and prove a 3-approximation algorithm, modified first-fit-decreasing-earliest for the general case and obtain more results for special cases. We then show how our results are applied in Cloud computing to improve energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of software depends on direct effects, which result from executing programs, as well as indirect effects, which influence the sustainability of the product incorporating the software. Indirect effects are caused, e.g., by planned obsolescence when a device manufacturer stops to provide software updates, rendering the device useless. In order to optimise direct effects, tools are required which provide methods for energy modelling and to analyse and optimize the energy consumption of a given program. Indirect effects are harder to assess, since their optimization requires changing economical incentives. However, it is important to optimise both kinds of effect in order to provide sustainable software, since the amount of energy consumed during the operation of a device is in the same order of magnitude as the energy used during its production. This chapter gives an overview of the various parameters involved and provides links to publications discussing optimization approaches.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained parallel applications on heterogeneous computing systems (HCSs) like cloud computing infrastructures. This kind of application was studied and used in many research works. Most of these works propose algorithms to minimize the completion time (makespan) without paying much attention to energy consumption. We propose a new parallel bi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that takes into account, not only makespan, but also energy consumption. We particularly focus on the island parallel model and the multi-start parallel model. Our new method is based on dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to minimize energy consumption. In terms of energy consumption, the obtained results show that our approach outperforms previous scheduling methods by a significant margin. In terms of completion time, the obtained schedules are also shorter than those of other algorithms. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the potential of DVS.},

	abstract = {Software engineering, as a central practice of digitalization, needs to become accountable for sustainability. In light of the ecological crises and the tremendous impact of digital systems on reshaping economic and social arrangements - often with negative side-effects - we need a sustainability transformation of the digital transformation. However, this is a complex and long-term task. In this article we combine an analysis of accountability arrangements in software engineering and a model of sustainability transformations to trace how certain dynamics are starting to make software engineering accountable for sustainability in the technological, cultural, economic and governance domains. The article discusses existing approaches for sustainable software engineering and software engineering for sustainability, traces emerging discourses that connect digitalization and sustainability, highlights new digital business models that may support sustainability and shows governance efforts to highlight ``green and digital'' policy problems. Yet, we argue that these are so far niche dynamics and that a sustainability transformation requires a collective and long-lasting effort to engender systemic changes. The goal should be to create varied accountability arrangements for sustainability in software engineering which is embedded in complex ways in society and economy.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to identify the important barriers for developing a long-term Artificial Intelligence (AI) cloud system in an Information Technology (IT) business. A fuzzy integrated hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model was established and applied to achieve this goal. In this ongoing analysis, Delphi was used to filter the most crucial ones from a list of 18 identified parameters, whereas, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the relevance of each parameter. Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) were further applied to identify the cause-effect relationship and to construct the hierarchical interrelationships among the parameters. Finally, to identify the driving and dependence parameters, Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) approach was used. The findings revealed that the most crucial elements in building a sustainable AI cloud system were technological, financial, and environmental concerns. More particularly, from all perspectives, digitalization is deemed to be the most critical within the group, with the greatest priority degree and significant driving as well as dependent tendency. According to ISM and MICMAC, user tendency to learn and R&D sector collaboration seems to be the most dependent and the independent factors respectively among the group. Remaining of the 13 factors are interrelated and operates as linkage obstacles. This study provides useful insights for IT firms trying to implement sustainable AI cloud systems and underlines the importance of including environmental and economic concerns into decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {The worldwide adoption of cloud data centers (CDCs) has given rise to the ubiquitous demand for hosting application services on the cloud. Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and generating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical cloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit and the COSCO framework show that HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption, SLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54 and 3 percent respectively.},

However, scheduling workflows and allocating resources is a difficult task due to factors such as task dependency, heterogeneity, and computational intensity. Resource allocation can pose significant challenges in terms of execution time and cost. As a result, there is a need to reduce energy consumption, makespan, and cost simultaneously, which is often framed as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient RL-based workflow scheduling framework for cloud computing. The framework integrates the X-NOR Whirlpool hashing algorithm to enhance security by allowing legitimate users into the cloud environment. The Linearly Weighted Moving Average - Sea Lion Optimization method is used to compute minimal parameters, the Jordan Normal Form - Deep Kronecker Neural Network is utilized for resource monitoring, and the Fuzzy Self-Defense algorithm is employed for efficient selection of virtual machines. We considered the Heterogeneous Computing Scheduling Problem (HCSP) and the Grid Workload Archive (GWA) - T-12 Bitbrains datasets to compare our proposed framework with existing works. Based on the result analysis, the proposed LJC Framework outperforms the QoS-HEFT, TCCS, and SHEFTEX algorithms, achieving better performance.},

	abstract = {The expansion of online services, the advent of big data, and the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology have led to an exponential growth in the number of data centers (DC). Within this new digital systems, DCs are the keystone. This poses major environmental problems through high energy consumption. The energy consumption growth of the DC's systems are expected to account for 3.2% of global carbon emissions by 2025. This remarkable growth in the energy consumption of DCs represents today a major challenge for energy efficiency. To meet these challenges, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) can be used to measure and optimize DC energy efficiency. Thus, accurate PUE prediction is challenging. Moreover, the non-linearity of the different DCs subsystems interactions and their inter-dependencies make the prediction of PUE more difficult since it is affected by complex factors such as workload variation, in addition to weather conditions and humidity, etc. In this paper, we present three machine learning models, MLP, Resilient Backpropagation-based DNN and Attention-based LSTM, to predict PUE values. The performance of these models has been evaluated using two datasets gathered from two case studies of real DCs. For both DC cases, experimental results showed that the attention-based LSTM model outperforms resilient backpropagation-based DNN and MLP models in terms of prediction errors and PUE.},

	abstract = {Many authors have proposed criteria to assess the ``environmental friendliness'' or ``sustainability'' of software products. However, a causal model that links observable properties of a software product to conditions of it being green or (more general) sustainable is still missing. Such a causal model is necessary because software products are intangible goods and, as such, only have indirect effects on the physical world. In particular, software products are not subject to any wear and tear, they can be copied without great effort, and generate no waste or emissions when being disposed of. Viewed in isolation, software seems to be a perfectly sustainable type of product. In real life, however, software products with the same or similar functionality can differ substantially in the burden they place on natural resources, especially if the sequence of released versions and resulting hardware obsolescence is taken into account. In this article, we present a model describing the causal chains from software products to their impacts on natural resources, including energy sources, from a life-cycle perspective. We focus on (i) the demands of software for hardware capacities (local, remote, and in the connecting network) and the resulting hardware energy demand, (ii) the expectations of users regarding such demands and how these affect hardware operating life, and (iii) the autonomy of users in managing their software use with regard to resource efficiency. We propose a hierarchical set of criteria and indicators to assess these impacts. We demonstrate the application of this set of criteria, including the definition of standard usage scenarios for chosen categories of software products. We further discuss the practicability of this type of assessment, its acceptability for several stakeholders and potential consequences for the eco-labeling of software products and sustainable software design.},

The container as a service has been recently introduced by cloud providers as a new service apart from traditional cloud services. Containers enable applications to run and deploy on isolated virtual space, and the operating system kernel is shared among them. Also, containerization has some attributes such as scalability, highly portable properties, and lightweight, for those reasons, it is applied for running isolated applications. Reducing energy consumption, as well as their CO2 emissions, are great deals for cloud providers. In this direction, consolidation is recommended as a vital energy-aware approach in cloud data centers. Previously, independent virtual machine migration or container migration was proposed in the literature for green computing in cloud data centers. However, this paper proposes a new cloud resource management procedure based on a multi-criteria decision-making method that takes advantage of a joint virtual machine and container migration approach concurrently. The results of simulations using ContainerCloudsim simulator validates the applicability of the proposed approach which shows notable reductions in energy consumption, SLA violation, and number of migrations in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The deployment of renewable energy generators such as PhotoVoltaic (PV) and wind farms is an attractive candidate to reduce the carbon footprint and, achieve the sustainable cloud datacenters. However, current studies have focused on geographical load balancing of Virtual Machine (VM) requests to reduce the cost of brown energy usage, while most of them have ignored the heterogeneity of power consumption of each cloud datacenter and the incurred performance degradation by VM co-location. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Energy Efficient Virtual Machine Allocation (EEE-VMA), a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based metaheuristic which supports a power heterogeneity aware VM request allocation of multiple sustainable cloud datacenters. This approach provides a novel metric called powerMark which diagnoses the power efficiency of each cloud datacenter in order to reduce the energy consumption of cloud datacenters more efficiently. Furthermore, performance degradation caused by VM co-location and bandwidth cost between cloud service users and cloud datacenters are considered to avoid the deterioration of Quality-of-Service (QoS) required by cloud service users by using our proposed cost model. Extensive experiments including real-world traces based simulation and the implementation of cloud testbed with a power measuring device are conducted to demonstrate the energy efficiency and performance assurance of the proposed EEE-VMA approach compared to the existing VM request allocation strategies.},

It has transformed resources into scalable services on demand and provides the only solution to the high resource requirements. All cloud service providers usually offer all types of services in the cloud computing environment, even though they also handle security-related challenges like reliability, availability, and throughput. One of the most decisive challenges in the cloud is handling faults. High fault tolerance in the cloud is a must to attain high performance, and the defects must be investigated and examined for future guidance. The principal target of this paper is to gain insight into the fault tolerance techniques that are available to us and the challenges that are required to be overcome. We concluded that there is always a relation between faults and energy consumption during our survey. If there is a high potential to tolerate a fault, there will be a need for more infrastructure and devices to fix those faults, which further leads to more power consumption. In this paper, 129 Research papers published through February 2022 were considered and further classified. This paper critically reviews techniques to toleratefaultsin cloud computing systems and discusses the taxonomy of errors, faults, and failures. Furthermore, this paper aims to investigate several critical research topics and advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, the Internet of Things, and machine learning, that may be employed as an intelligent fault tolerance strategy in the cloud environment.},

In this study, a strong agile response task scheduling optimization algorithm is proposed on the basis of the peak energy consumption of data centers and the time span of task scheduling. Agile response optimization techniques are also adopted. From the perspective of task failure rate, the proposed algorithm can be used to investigate the strong agile response optimization model, explore the probability density function of the task request queue overflow, and request a timeout to avoid network congestion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the stability and efficiency of task scheduling and effectively improve the throughput of the cloud computing system.},

	abstract = {With the increase of mega-cities, the demand for Smart Cities is overgrowing. The mega-cities can be smarter through the Cloud of Things (CoT). Efficient energy consumption in Smart Cities has a massive impact on the environment. But, computational power is increasing rapidly in the cloud computing environment. Enormous energy consumption (EC) and Service Level Agreement violation (SLAV) becomes a key concern. The Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation approach can significantly reduce EC, SLA violation (SLAV), and increase resource utilization. However, dynamic VM consolidation may produce performance degradation of Physical Machines (PMs) and SLAV. Therefore, it becomes essential to find a trade-off between EC and SLAV. Herein, a novel New Linear Regression(NLR) prediction model, host overload/underload, and VM placement policy have been proposed to reduce EC and SLAV. The NLR model's primary intention is to take that the model goes through a straight line and a mean point. Future CPU utilization is predicted based on the proposed NLR model. Evaluation of proposed algorithms has been accomplished by extending CloudSim Simulator. The experiment shows that proposed algorithms reduced EC and SLAV in cloud data centers and can be used to construct a smart and sustainable environment for Smart Cities.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to handle the non-linear power consumption model, complex workflow structures, and diverse user-defined deadlines for energy-efficient workflow scheduling in sustainable cloud computing. Although metaheuristics are very attractive to solve this problem, most of the existing work regards the problem as a black-box and ignores the use of domain knowledge. To make up for their shortcomings, this paper tailors an energy-aware intelligent scheduling algorithm (EIS) with three new mechanisms. First, we derive the optimal execution time that minimizes energy consumption for each task on a given resource. Second, based on the optimal execution time of each workflow task, the EIS distributes the workflow slack time (difference between its completion time and deadline) to reduce the voltages and frequencies of task executions for energy saving. Third, the EIS mines the idle time gaps caused by task precedence constraints to further reduce dynamic energy consumption whilst satisfying workflows' deadline constraints. To measure the performance of the EIS, we conduct extensive comparison experiments based on actual workflow applications. The results demonstrate that the energy consumption of the EIS is much lower than that of the competitors under different deadlines, and has a faster descend rate with the evolution process.},

	abstract = {Minimizing the energy consumption of servers within cloud computing systems is of upmost importance to cloud providers toward reducing operational costs and enhancing service sustainability by consolidating services onto fewer active servers. Moreover, providers must also provision high levels of availability and reliability, hence cloud services are frequently replicated across servers that subsequently increases server energy consumption and resource overhead. These two objectives can present a potential conflict within cloud resource management decision making that must balance between service consolidation and replication to minimize energy consumption whilst maximizing server availability and reliability, respectively. In this paper, we propose a cuckoo optimization-based energy-reliability aware resource scheduling technique (CRUZE) for holistic management of cloud computing resources including servers, networks, storage, and cooling systems. CRUZE clusters and executes heterogeneous workloads on provisioned cloud resources and enhances the energy-efficiency and reduces the carbon footprint in datacenters without adversely affecting cloud service reliability. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRUZE against existing state-of-the-art solutions using the CloudSim toolkit. Results indicate that our proposed technique is capable of reducing energy consumption by 20.1% whilst improving reliability and CPU utilization by 17.1% and 15.7% respectively without affecting other Quality of Service parameters.},

However, the full commitment to Cloud Computing necessary to gain the full benefit is a major project for any organisation, since it necessitates adoption of new business processes and attitudes to computing services in addition to the immediately obvious systems changes. Hence the evaluation of a Cloud Computing project needs to consider the balance of benefits and risks to the organisation in the full context of the environment in which it operates; it is not sufficient or appropriate to examine technical considerations alone. In this paper, we consider the application of CAPM, a well established approach used for the analysis of risks and benefits of commercial projects to Cloud adoption projects and propose a revised and improved technique, OSM. To support the validity of OSM, two full case studies are presented. In the first, we describe an application of the approach to the iSolutions Group at University of Southampton, which focuses on evaluations of Cloud Computing service improvement. We then illustrate the use of OSM for measuring learning satisfaction of two cohort groups at the University of Greenwich. The results confirm the advantages of using OSM. We conclude that OSM can analyse the risk and return status of Cloud Computing services and help organisations that adopt Cloud Computing to evaluate and review their Cloud Computing projects and services.

It is important to design a system that improves energy efficiency by allocating resources to applications in a smart way while still meeting QoS requirements for applications. Moreover, the security of information that is being processed during the migration process is also one of the important tasks.

Existing scheduling approaches are inadequate for real-time tasks running in uncertain cloud environments, because those approaches assume that cloud computing environments are deterministic and pre-computed schedule decisions will be statically followed during schedule execution. In this paper, we address this issue. We introduce an interval number theory to describe the uncertainty of the computing environment and a scheduling architecture to mitigate the impact of uncertainty on the task scheduling quality for a cloud data center. Based on this architecture, we present a novel scheduling algorithm (PRS11Proactive and Reactive Scheduling.) that dynamically exploits proactive and reactive scheduling methods, for scheduling real-time, aperiodic, independent tasks. To improve energy efficiency, we propose three strategies to scale up and down the system's computing resources according to workload to improve resource utilization and to reduce energy consumption for the cloud data center. We conduct extensive experiments to compare PRS with four typical baseline scheduling algorithms. The experimental results show that PRS performs better than those algorithms, and can effectively improve the performance of a cloud data center.},

Subsequently, the convex optimization technique is engaged to compute an appropriate quantity of physical servers for each monitoring window. This quantity of interest is calculated to ensure that a minimum number of servers can still provide an acceptable quality of service. Finally, a corresponding migrating instruction is issued to stack the virtual machines and turn off the idle physical servers to achieve the objective of energy savings.

The average consumption of a single data center is equivalent to the energy consumption of 25.000 households. Modeling the power consumption for these infrastructures is crucial to anticipate the effects of aggressive optimization policies, but accurate and fast power modeling is a complex challenge for high-end servers not yet satisfied by analytical approaches. This work proposes an automatic method, based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization, for the identification of power models of enterprise servers in Cloud data centers. Our approach, as opposed to previous procedures, does not only consider the workload consolidation for deriving the power model, but also incorporates other non traditional factors like the static power consumption and its dependence with temperature. Our experimental results shows that we reach slightly better models than classical approaches, but simul- taneously simplifying the power model structure and thus the numbers of sensors needed, which is very promising for a short-term energy prediction.

	abstract = {With the increasing popularity of cloud computing products, task scheduling problem has become a hot research topic in this field. The task scheduling problem of cloud computing system is more complex than the traditional distributed system. Based on the analysis of cloud computing in related literature, we established a simplified model for task scheduling system in cloud computing.Different from the previous research of cloud computing task scheduling algorithm, the simplified model in this paper is based on game theory as a mathematical tool. Based on game theory, the task scheduling algorithm considering the reliability of the balanced task is proposed. Based on the balanced scheduling algorithm, the task scheduling model for computing nodes is proposed. In the cooperative game model, game strategy is used for the task in the calculation of rate allocation strategy on the node. Through analysis of experimental results, it is shown that the proposed algorithm has better optimization effect.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing continues to play a major role in transforming the IT industry by facilitating elastic on-demand provisioning of computational resources including processors, storage and networks. This is necessarily accompanied by the creation, and refreshes, of large-scale systems including cluster, grids and datacenters from which such resources are provided. These systems consume substantial amounts of energy, with associated costs, leading to significant CO2 emissions. In 2014, these systems consumed 70billion kWh of energy in US; this is 1.8% of the US total energy consumption, and future consumption is expected to continue around this level with approximately 73billion kWh by 2020. The energy bills for major cloud service providers are typically the second largest item in their budgets due to the increased number of computational resources. Energy efficiency in these systems serves the providers interests in saving money to enable reinvestment, reduce supply costs and also reduces CO2 emissions. In this paper, we discuss energy consumption in large scale computing systems, such as scientific high performance computing systems, clusters, grids and clouds, and whether it is possible to decrease energy consumption without detrimental impact on service quality and performance. We discuss a number of approaches, reported in the literature, that claim to improve the energy efficiency of such large scale computing systems, and identify a number of open challenges. Key findings include: (i) in clusters and grids, use of system level efficiency techniques might increase their energy consumption; (ii) in (virtualized) clouds, efficient scheduling and resource allocation can lead to substantially greater economies than consolidation through migration; and (iii) in clusters, switching off idle resources is more energy efficient, however in (production) clouds, performance is affected due to demand fluctuation.},

	abstract = {Workload consolidation is a phase in Cloud datacenter where tasks are allocated among the available hosts in such a way that a minimal number of hosts is used and users' need in terms of service level agreement (SLA) is fulfilled. To achieve workload consolidation, hosts are divided among three groups based on their utilization namely overloaded hosts, underloaded host and normal hosts. Detection of over or underloaded host is a challenging issue. Most of the existing researchers propose to use threshold values for such detection. We believe that there is a scope of improvement in existing methods of deciding underloaded hosts and subsequently taking off virtual machines (VMs) from them and placing them on other hosts. In this research, we propose Host Utilization Aware (HUA) Algorithm for underloaded host detection and placing its VMs on other hosts in a dynamic Cloud environment. We compare our proposed mechanism with existing one and with empirical analysis; it is shown that our proposal results into shutting off more number of hosts without compromising user's workload requirement which leads to an energy-efficient workload consolidation with minimal migration costs and efficient utilization of active hosts.},

	abstract = {The increasing cost in power consumption in data centers, and the corresponding environmental threats have raised a growing demand in energy-efficient computing. Despite its importance, little work was done on introducing models to manage the consumption efficiently. With the growing use of Cloud Computing, this issue becomes very crucial. In a Cloud Computing, the services run in a data center on a set of clusters that are managed by the Cloud computing environment. The services are provided in the form of a Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The amount of energy consumed by the underutilized and overloaded computing systems may be substantial. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling algorithms to take into account the power consumption of the Cloud for energy-efficient resource utilization. On the other hand, Cloud computing is seen as crucial for high performance computing; for instance for the purpose of Big Data processing, and that should not be much compromised for the sake of reducing energy consumption. In this work, we derive an energy-aware tasks scheduling (EATS) model, which divides and schedules a big data in the Cloud. The main goal of EATS is to increase the application efficiency and reduce the energy consumption of the underlying resources. The power consumption of a computing server was measured under different working load conditions. Experiments show that the ratio of energy consumption at peak performance compared to an idle state is 1.3. This shows that resources must be utilized correctly without scarifying performance. The results of the proposed approach are very promising and encouraging. Hence, the adoption of such strategies by the cloud providers result in energy saving for data centers.},

Now, instead of buying their own IT resources, they can use the services offered by Cloud Computing with reasonable costs based on a ``pay-per-use'' model. However, with the wide adoption of Cloud Computing, the costs for maintaining the Cloud infrastructure have become a vital issue for the providers, especially with the large input of energy costs to underpin these resources. Thus, this paper proposes a system architecture that can be used for profiling the resources usage in terms of the energy consumption. From the profiled data, the application developers can enhance their energy-aware decisions when creating or optimising the applications to be more energy efficient. This paper also presents an adapted existing Cloud architecture to enable energy-aware profiling based on the proposed system.

	abstract = {Green Computing is a recent trend in computer science, which tries to reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint produced by computers on distributed platforms such as clusters, grids, and clouds. Traditional scheduling solutions attempt to minimize processing times without taking into account the energetic cost. One of the methods for reducing energy consumption is providing scheduling policies in order to allocate tasks on specific resources that impact over the processing times and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a real-time dynamic scheduling system to execute efficiently task-based applications on distributed computing platforms in order to minimize the energy consumption. Scheduling tasks on multiprocessors is a well known NP-hard problem and optimal solution of these problems is not feasible, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that combines a set of heuristic rules and a resource allocation technique in order to get good solutions on an affordable time scale. The proposed algorithm minimizes a multi-objective function which combines the energy-consumption and execution time according to the energy-performance importance factor provided by the resource provider or user, also taking into account sequence-dependent setup times between tasks, setup times and down times for virtual machines (VM) and energy profiles for different architectures. A prototype implementation of the scheduler has been tested with different kinds of DAG generated at random as well as on real task-based COMPSs applications. We have tested the system with different size instances and importance factors, and we have evaluated which combination provides a better solution and energy savings. Moreover, we have also evaluated the introduced overhead by measuring the time for getting the scheduling solutions for a different number of tasks, kinds of DAG, and resources, concluding that our method is suitable for run-time scheduling.},

Specific operators to decrease execution time and energy consumption are designed. An improvement operator is also designed to enhance the diversity of the non-dominated solutions. The proposed algorithm is compared with the standard heuristic methods and a parallel bi-objective genetic algorithm (bGA). The comparative results show the Pareto solution set by the proposed algorithm is able to dominate a large proportion of those solutions by both the heuristic methods and the bGA.},

First, the variation of energy consumption with the performance of servers is taken into account; second, data locality can be adjusted dynamically according to current network state; last but not least, considering that task-scheduling strategies depend directly on data placement policies, we formulate the problem as an integer bi-level programming model. In order to solve the model efficiently, specific-design encoding and decoding methods are introduced. Based on these, a new effective multi-objective genetic algorithm based on MOEA/D is proposed. As there are usually tens of thousands of tasks to be scheduled in the cloud, this is a large-scale optimization problem and a local search operator is designed to accelerate convergent speed of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

Furthermore, such core allocation and task scheduling should be conducted with energy constraints or performance constraints. The problems of energy and time constrained scheduling of precedence constrained parallel tasks on multiple manycore processors in a cloud computing environment are defined as optimization problems. Lower bounds for optimal solutions are generalized from a single parallel computing system to multiple parallel computing systems. Our approach in this paper is to design and analyze the performance of heuristic algorithms that employ the equal-speed method. Pre-power-determination algorithms and post-power-determination algorithms are developed for both energy and time constrained scheduling of precedence constrained parallel tasks on multiple manycore processors with continuous or discrete speed levels. The performance of these algorithms are evaluated analytically and experimentally. Our main strategy is to embed the equal-speed method into our algorithms, which not only makes our analysis possible, but also yields good performance of our algorithms.},

However, compared to VM resizing, live migrations can negatively impact the performance of the system depending on the amount of transferred data and the path length. In this paper, we propose an online resource allocation algorithm using VM consolidation to achieve energy efficiency and reduce service-level agreement (SLA) violations of data centers while considering the power usage of servers, the number of migrations, and the path length of migrations in DCNs.

	abstract = {Energy management has become increasingly necessary in large-scale cloud data centers to address high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. In this work, we combine three management techniques that can be used to control cloud data centers in an energy-efficient manner: changing the number of virtual machines, the number of cores, and scaling the CPU frequencies. We present a feedback controller that determines an optimal configuration to minimize energy consumption while meeting performance objectives. The controller can be configured to accomplish these goals in a stable manner, without causing large oscillations in the resource allocations. To meet the needs of individual applications under different workload conditions, the controller parameters are automatically adjusted at runtime based on a system model that is learned online. The potential of the proposed approach is evaluated in a video encoding scenario. The results show that our combined approach achieves up to 34% energy savings compared to the constituent approaches---core change, virtual machine change, and CPU frequency change policies, while meeting the performance target.},

This scheduler considers each VM workload type (CPU or I/O-bound) to decide on its allocation. Scheduler is able to reduce energy consumption, as well as SLA violations on this cloud environment, avoiding performance losses by allocating simultaneously VMs which run different types of tasks. The scheduler method was validated through simulations conducted with the CloudSim framework. Two synthetic benchmarks representing both workload types were run previously in VMs in order to obtain basic data to design the scheduler. Thus, it was possible to implement a scheduling method that employs a VM allocation policy based on features of each application. Results showed that knowing the specifications and characteristics of environment may contribute to a better usage of resources, leading to an increased level of services availability and, finally, reducing problems caused by competition in resource usage.},

	abstract = {Context: Application of component based software engineering methods to heterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurations to realize the same function with different non--functional properties (NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs is a non--trivial task. Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF) with the goal to acquire a (sub--) optimal software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of a software configuration in its early design phase. We focus on the software configuration optimization for the average energy consumption and average execution time. Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real--world demonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness of our model through comparing the performance prediction of six software configurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensive measurements with a confidence interval of 95%. Secondly, to demonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configuration optimization on 55 generated use--cases (with solution spaces ranging from 1030 to 3070) and benchmark the results against best performing random configurations. Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by our framework matched the configuration implemented and measured on a real--world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtain sub--optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7% and 13% from the optimal configuration (respectfully). Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform and reliably predict the performance of software configuration in the early design phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allows software architects to model architectural constraints and preferences, acting as a multi--criterion software architecture decision support system. In addition to said, we also point out several interesting research directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.},

One of the major challenges involved, is to provide a high level of Quality of Service (QoS) in a cost-effective way for the end users and in an energy-efficient manner for the cloud providers. Towards this direction, this paper presents an energy-efficient, QoS-aware and cost-effective scheduling strategy for real-time workflow applications in cloud computing systems. The proposed approach utilizes per-core Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on the underlying heterogeneous multi-core processors, as well as approximate computations, in order to fill in schedule gaps. At the same time, it takes into account the effects of input error on the processing time of the component tasks. Our goal is to provide timeliness and energy efficiency by trading off result precision, while keeping the result quality of the completed jobs at an acceptable standard and the monetary cost required for the execution of the jobs at a reasonable level. The proposed scheduling heuristic is compared to two other baseline policies, under the impact of various QoS requirements. The simulation experiments reveal that our approach outperforms the other examined policies, providing promising results.},

@article{MALEKLOO20189,
	abstract = {Cloud computing is a promising paradigm that enables a ``computing-as-a-service'' model, in which a dynamic pool of virtualized computational resources (e.g. CPU) can be leased and released on demand. With the increased demand for cloud computing infrastructures and the explosion in data center sizes, energy efficiency becomes an important issue to consider. Green cloud computing is an area that focuses on the design of energy efficient data centers, in order to achieve cost savings and minimize negative impacts on the environment. One of the main green cloud computing strategies used for the reduction of energy consumption consists in maximizing the utilization of a number of physical machines (PMs) and turning off or suspending unused servers. This strategy is typically achieved using two types of algorithms: Virtual Machines (VMs) placement and VMs consolidation algorithms. VMs' placement is a process of dynamically placing VMs onto PMs while satisfying specific VM-to-PM mapping rules. VMs' consolidation optimizes the resource utilization and groups dispersed VMs on a minimal number of active PMs, based on live migration techniques. Both approaches are time and resource consuming, and are categorized as NP-hard optimization problems. Moreover, reducing energy consumption by means of resource consolidation may reduce the system's availability and reliability, and lead to SLA violations. Therefore, there is a need for multi-objective optimization approaches that can strike a balance between energy consumption and the system's ability to meet QoS and SLA requirements. In this work, we propose an energy-aware and QoS-aware multi-objective Ant Colony Optimization (MACO) approach for VM placement and consolidation. Our approach aims at achieving a trade-off between energy efficiency, system performance, and SLA-compliance. The proposed approach was implemented and tested in small to mid-size data center settings, simulated using cloudSim, and was compared with a number of heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches, using eight performance metrics. The results show that our approach outperforms the other tested approaches in terms of energy savings, reduction of resource wastage in term of CPU, reduction of communication cost in term of energy induced by traffic load exchanged between VMs, and minimization of the number of VM migrations and SLA violations -- thus demonstrating an ability to balance energy efficiency with system performance and QoS requirements.},

	abstract = {In a heterogeneous Cloud network scenario where a Cloud computing data center serves mobile Cloud computing requests, Cloud providers are expected to implement more innovative and effective solutions for a list of long standing challenges. Energy efficiency in the Cloud data center is one of the more pressing issues near the top of that list. Cloud providers are in constant pursuit of a system that satisfies client demands for resources, maximizes availability and other service level agreement metrics while minimizing energy consumption and, in turn, minimizing Cloud providers' cost. In this work, we introduce a novel mathematical optimization model to solve the problem of energy efficiency in a cloud data center. Next, we offer a solution based on VM migration that tackles this problem and minimizes energy efficiency in comparison to other common solutions. This solution includes a novel proposed technique to be integrated in any consolidation-based energy efficiency solution. This technique depends on dynamic idleness prediction (DIP) using machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we offer a robust energy efficiency scheduling solution that does not depend on live migration. This technique, termed Smart VM Over Provision (SVOP), offers a major advantage to cloud providers in the cases when live migration of VMs is not preferred due to its effects on performance. We evaluate the aforementioned solutions in terms of a number of critical metrics, namely, energy used per server, energy used per served request, acceptance rate, and the number of migrations performed.},

Using these cost models, a comparison is made of physical clusters with cloud clusters of a similar size and performance. The results show that cloud clusters are an interesting option for start-ups and other organizations with a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the computational requirements, while physical clusters are still more economically viable for organizations with a high usage rate.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing slowly gained an important role in scientific application, on-demand facility of virtualized resources is provided as a service with the help of virtualization without any additional waiting time. Energy consumption is reduced for job scheduling problems based on makespan constraint which in turn leads to significant decrease in the energy cost. Additionally, there is an increase in complexity for scheduling problems mainly because the application is not based on makespan constraint. In this paper we propose a new Hybrid algorithm combining the benefits of ACO and cuckoo search algorithm. It is focused on the voltage scaling factor for reduction of energy consumption. Performance of the Hybrid algorithm is considerably increased from 45 tasks onward when compared to ACO. Energy consumed by Hybrid algorithm is measured and energy improvement is evaluated up to 35 tasks. Energy consumption is the same as ACO algorithm because as the number of tasks increases (45 to 70) there is a considerable decrease in the energy consumption rate. Makespan of Hybrid algorithm based on number of tasks is compared with ACO algorithm. Further we have analyzed the energy consumption for a number of processors and its improvement rate -- up to 6 processors, energy consumption is considerably reduced and the energy consumption tends to be in steady state with further increase in the number of processors.},

	abstract = {One feature of MapReduce is to split user request into multiple tasks and then process around multiple datacenters for cloud computing. This study addresses an energy efficiency problem of dynamic cloud hosts (CHs) and task assignments as well as a subset of CH power-on or suspended schedules by controlling the range between the power-on and suspended thresholds for high-energy efficiency. A dynamical CHs and tasks assignment scheme is proposed to reduce the overall system energy consumption. The main concept of the proposed scheme entails setting the thresholds to satisfy the constant and variable traffic loads, nodal load balance, migration overhead, basic required power, and processing power. The reason is the established energy consumption required for initialing power-on and variable rates to keep working. This work evaluates the proposed scheme and compares it with the CHs and tasks assignment schemes to show how the proposed scheme achieves energy efficiency. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme obtains the lowest energy consumption under the tolerable responding time constraints even though the request traffic load is varying. The average improvement rate is 16.3% to balance the number of active hosts and migration overhead as well as 4.8% for task schedule.},

	abstract = {Communication performance over distant nodes and high power consumption are major challenges for efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures. Wireless NoCs, by augmenting wired topologies with low latency wireless links, overcome performance limitations of conventional NoCs. However, NoC routers and Wireless Interfaces (WIs) consume significant amount of leakage power. The usage of routers in NoC is application dependent and for most applications, performance requirement can be achieved without operating all resources all the time. Similarly, WIs transmitting data over shared channel can be selectively turned off when they are not active. Exploiting these, we propose Power- and Performance-aware NoC (P2NoC) architecture that power gates router elements and WIs depending upon their utilization to reduce leakage power. P2NoC works based on hybrid two-level router utilization estimate; pre-computed and runtime to provide coarse and fine estimate of utilization to maximize power saving while keeping overheads and performance impact to a minimum. We also propose deadlock-free seamless bypass routing strategy with P2NoC to avoid adverse impacts of power gating. P2NoC saves up to 92.20% and 68.23% of leakage power in base and hybrid routers respectively with only 7% area overhead. Based on utilization, P2NoC also reduces total average packet energy consumption by 49% with negligible performance degradation. The proposed solution provides a flexible sustainable computing platform that can be optimized for a wide range of application scenarios.},

Existing Virtual Machines (VMs) scheduling schemes have mainly focused on enhancing the cluster resource utilization and reducing power consumption by improving the legacy ``bin-packing'' algorithm. However, different resource-intensive applications running on VMs in realistic scenarios have significant effects on the system performance and energy consumption. Furthermore, instantaneous peak loads may lead to a scheduling error, which can significantly impede the energy efficiency of scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling approach named PreAntPolicy that consists of a prediction model based on fractal mathematics and a scheduler on the basis of an improved ant colony algorithm. The prediction model determines whether to trigger the execution of the scheduler by virtue of load trend prediction, and the scheduler is responsible for resource scheduling while minimizing energy consumption under the premise of guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS). Through extensive analysis and simulation experiments using real workload traces from the compute clusters of Google, the performance results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits excellent energy efficiency and resource utilization. Moreover, this approach offers an effective dynamic capacity provisioning model for resource-intensive applications in a heterogeneous computing environment and can reduce the consumption of system resources and energy when scheduling is triggered by instantaneous peak loads.},

Employing Lyapunov Optimization techniques, an optimal control framework is designed and analyzed to make energy and QoE decisions in MSPs.

	abstract = {VM consolidation is an important technique used in cloud computing systems to improve energy efficiency. It migrates the running VMs from under utilized physical resources to other resources in order to reduce the energy consumption. But in a cloud computing environment with failure prone resources, focusing solely on energy efficiency has adverse effects. If the reliability factor of resources is ignored then the running VMs may get consolidated to unreliable physical resources. This will cause more failures and recreations of VMs, thus increasing the energy consumption. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a failure-aware VM consolidation mechanism, which takes the occurrence of failures and the hazard rate of physical resources into consideration before performing VM consolidation. We proposed a failure prediction technique based on exponential smoothing to trigger two fault tolerance mechanisms (VM migration and VM checkpointing). A simulation based evaluation of the proposed VM consolidation mechanism was conducted by using real failure traces. The results demonstrate that by using the combination of checkpointing and VM migration with the proposed failure-aware VM consolidation mechanism, the energy consumption of cloud computing system is reduced by 34% and reliability is improved by 12% while decreasing the occurrence of failures by 14%.},

With this holistic view of sustainability in mind, we provide evaluations of the environmental impacts of memory and cache options for Parsec and SPEC multi-program workloads. Using indifference point analysis, we determine which architectural decisions are the most sustainable in the context of these workloads for various usage scenarios. Through a form of break even analysis, we show the impact of upgrading to a new technology node. Our analysis of current processor trends indicates that upgrading may require upwards of 10 years of service time to break even, and that designing systems with smaller cache and main memory sizes may provide an overall positive environmental trend without dramatically reducing performance.},

However, addressing sustainability in software projects might have an impact on the quality of the software product delivered. Conflicting goals between sustainability and particular software product characteristics should be studied when developing application software, since achieving users' requirements can be a hindrance in the quest to meet sustainability goals.
Objective
This paper aims to provide an overview of the approaches found in the literature for dealing with interactions between software product quality and sustainability in the context of application software.
Method
A systematic mapping study is conducted to identify practices for managing interactions between software quality characteristics and sustainability. The selected papers are classified according to the quality characteristic considered and their influence on sustainability.
Results
Most of the 66 selected papers focused on validating current technologies concerning their support for sustainability (46%%). The interaction between performance efficiency and energy efficiency is what is reported most and there is a fairly positive interaction. In addition, reliability and usability point to a positive interaction with energy efficiency, while security shows a conflicting interaction with energy efficiency. Functional suitability and maintainability can present both positive and negative interaction, with different goals derived from environmental sustainability.
Conclusions
Interactions between software quality and sustainability have been addressed within an explorative approach. There is a need for additional research work to characterize the impact of interaction on both software quality and sustainability. Furthermore, proposals should be validated in industrial settings.},

	abstract = {The internet era in general, and information technology in particular, have enabled synthesis between different types of information systems across a company's divisions in ways that were previously impossible. EBA software is usually measured as a single construct, whereas this study has deconstructed the term, EBA software, to provide a comprehensive understanding of its roles from a theoretical perspective and the impact on operational excellence and collaboration between EBA software-enabled departments offers. This paper intends to investigate the roles of electronic business application software from three dimensions and explore if these dimensions affect collaboration between departments and operational excellence. An online survey was performed using Google forms to gather information from the fast-food restaurant sector, with SEM being performed to examine the study's structural and measurement model. The study results show that while some EBA software dimensions positively influenced operational excellence, some did not. The results also confirm that certain dimensions of EBA software have a significant effect on department collaboration. The hypothesis of the mediating impact of department collaboration using sustainable software on operational excellence was accepted. The study offers recommendations and suggestions for supervisors and managers in the fast-food sector in Jordan in terms of being potentially beneficial in implementing efficient and effective electronic business application software to attain operational excellence and sustain it. The study also suggests that applying sustainable software that has a beneficial impact on companies' achievements. This paper is recognized as the first to study the Jordanian e-business fast-food restaurant sector, which has witnessed an accelerated increase in investment in e-business solutions to support the processes of a company itself as well as its suppliers and partners. This research presents a valid and reliable measurement scale adjusted for the Jordanian fast-food restaurant sector. Furthermore, the significant impact that EBA software has on department collaboration relating to operational excellence adds to the various information offered by the more exhaustive research field of e-business.},

Auto-scaling is an important cloud computing technique that dynamically allocates computational resources to applications to match their current loads precisely, thereby removing resources that would otherwise remain idle and waste power. This paper presents a model-driven engineering approach to optimizing the configuration, energy consumption, and operating cost of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure to create greener computing environments that reduce emissions resulting from superfluous idle resources. The paper provides four contributions to the study of model-driven configuration of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure by (1) explaining how virtual machine configurations can be captured in feature models, (2) describing how these models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for configuration and energy consumption optimization, (3) showing how optimal auto-scaling configurations can be derived from these CSPs with a constraint solver, and (4) presenting a case study showing the energy consumption/cost reduction produced by this model-driven approach.},

	abstract = {High energy consumption has become a growing concern in the operation of complex cloud data centers due to the ever-expanding size of cloud computing facilities and the ever-increasing number of users. It is critical to find viable solutions to cloud task scheduling so that cloud resources can be utilized in an energy-efficient way while still meeting diverse user requirements in real time. In this research we propose a Q-learning based task scheduling framework for energy-efficient cloud computing (QEEC). QEEC has two phases. In the first phase a centralized task dispatcher is used to implement the M/M/S queueing model, by which the arriving user requests are assigned to each server in a cloud. In the second phase a Q-learning based scheduler on each server first prioritizes all the requests by task laxity and task life time, then uses a continuously-updating policy to assign tasks to virtual machines, applying incentives to reward the assignments that can minimize task response time and maximize each server's CPU utilization. We have conducted simulation experiments, which have confirmed that implementing a M/M/S queueing system in a cloud can help to reduce the average task response time. The experiments have also demonstrated that the QEEC approach is the most energy-efficient as compared to other task scheduling policies, which can be largely credited to the M/M/S queueing model and the Q-learning strategy implemented in QEEC.},

@article{KHAN2021102869,
	abstract = {In major Information Technology (IT) companies such as Google, Rackspace and Amazon Web Services (AWS), virtualisation and containerisation technologies are usually used to execute customers' workloads and applications. The computational resources are provided through large-scale datacenters, which consume substantial amount of energy and have, therefore, ecological impacts. Since long, Google runs users' applications in containers, Rackspace offers bare-metal hardware, whereas AWS runs them either in VMs (EC2), containers (ECS) and/or containers inside VMs (Lambda); therefore, making resource management a tedious activity. The role of a resource management system is of the greatest importance, principally, if IT companies practice various kinds of sand-boxing technologies, for instance, bare-metal, VMs, containers, and/or nested containers in their datacenters (hybrid platforms). The absence of centralised, workload-aware resource managers and consolidation policies produces questions on datacenters energy efficiency, workloads performance, and users' costs. In this paper, we demonstrate, through several experiments, using the Google workload data for 12,583 hosts and approximately one million tasks that belong to four different kinds of workload, the likelihood of: (i) using workload-aware resource managers in hybrid clouds; (ii) achieving energy and cost savings, in heterogeneous hybrid datacenters such that the workload performance is not affected, negatively; and (iii) how various allocation policies, combined with different migration approaches, will impact on datacenter's energy and performance efficiencies. Using plausible assumptions for hybrid datacenters set-up, our empirical evaluation suggests that, for no migration, a single scheduler is at most 16.86% more energy efficient than distributed schedulers. Moreover, when migrations are considered, our resource manager can save up to 45.61% energy and can improve up to 17.9% workload performance.},

Then a two-level hybrid adaptive model was designed to predict the VM load efficiently and accurately, including CPU and memory load. Bayesian algorithm was used for classification to select the applications that increase the CPU of a VM by more than 5%, then giving the CPU and memory load prediction of VMs by aANFIS model. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the elastic allocation strategy can improve the VMs performance and resource utilization.},

	abstract = {Energy-efficient resource scheduling has become a hot issue in the field of cloud computing. However, there is an inevitable conflict between energy-saving and QoS optimization. In real-world scenarios, the volatility of cloud task arrival will cause the optimization problem to become more difficult. To achieve a better trade-off between these two goals, a novel resource scheduling framework based on collaborative optimization is proposed for the cloud computing environment. Based on the Lyapunov optimization method, the optimization problem can be solved explicitly in each time slice. We build a multi virtual machine queuing model and analyze the relationships between the task queues' backlog and the system energy consumption. We also introduce a method of using stacked denoising auto-encoder for extracting the QoS features to improve the constraints of the collaborative optimization objective function. Finally, we propose an efficient resource scheduling strategy to give full play to the processing capabilities of the virtual machine. Experimental results show that, compared with other advanced energy-saving strategies, our scheduling strategy can effectively reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center while guaranteeing QoS, and reduce the total scheduling time cost of data center by more than 20%.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing services have gained tremendous popularity and widespread adoption due to their flexible and on-demand nature. Cloud computing services are hosted in Cloud Data Centers (CDC) that deploy thousands of computation, storage, and communication devices leading to high energy utilization and carbon emissions. Renewable energy resources replace fossil fuels based grid energy to effectively reduce carbon emissions of CDCs. Moreover, waste heat generated from electronic components can be utilized in absorption based cooling systems to offset cooling costs of data centers. However, data centers need to be located at ideal geographical locations to reap benefits of renewable energy and waste heat recovery options. Modular Data Centers (MDC) can enable energy as a location paradigm due to their shippable nature. Moreover, workload can be transferred between intelligently placed geographically dispersed data centers to utilize renewable energy available elsewhere with virtual machine migration techniques. However, adoption of aforementioned sustainability techniques and technologies opens new challenges, such as, intermittency of power supply from renewable resources and higher capital costs. In this paper, we examine sustainable CDCs from various aspects to survey the enabling techniques and technologies. We present case studies from both academia and industry that demonstrate favorable results for sustainability measures in CDCs. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art research in sustainable CDCs. Furthermore, we debate the integration challenges and open research issues to sustainable CDCs.},

	abstract = {Virtual machine (VM) migration is an indispensable aspect of a virtualized cloud environment. It assists in resource management by dynamically relocating VMs from one physical machine to another. This is an essential aspect especially for big data applications that are prone to variable workloads and often demand relocation of resources in terms of VMs. However, such applications not only experience stochastic workloads but also have stringent requirements on the maximum tolerable latency. To address such issues, VMs are often relocated using live VM migration. VM migration is associated with overheads, hence, in this paper, we propose a modified serial migration strategy to migrate multiple VMs based on the pre-copy live migration technique. We propose to interleave the pre-copy stages in such a way that a balance is achieved between the migration time and downtime overheads. The proposed technique is compared with the state-of-the-art serial, parallel, and improved serial migration strategies. Concerning downtime, the proposed approach performs exceptionally well compared to both serial and improved serial methods. The downtime of the proposed scheme and parallel are comparative for read-intensive applications (low dirtying rates). However, for write-intensive applications (high dirtying rates) the former significantly outperforms the latter. The migration time performance of the proposed scheme is observed to be much better than that of the parallel technique and is slightly higher than those of serial and improved serial techniques.},

	abstract = {In virtualized cloud computing systems, energy reduction is a serious concern since it can offer many major advantages, such as reducing running costs, increasing system efficiency, and protecting the environment. At the same time, an energy-efficient task scheduling strategy is a viable way to meet these goals. Unfortunately, mapping cloud resources to user requests to achieve good performance by minimizing the energy consumption of cloud resources within a user-defined deadline is a huge challenge. This paper proposes Energy and Performance-Efficient Task Scheduling Algorithm (EPETS) in a heterogeneous virtualized cloud to resolve the issue of energy consumption. There are two stages in the proposed algorithm: initial scheduling helps to reduce execution time and satisfy task deadlines without considering energy consumption, and the second stage task reassignment scheduling to find the best execution location within the deadline limit with less energy consumption. Moreover, to make a reasonable balance between task scheduling and energy saving, we suggest an energy-efficient task priority system. The simulation results show that, compared to current energy-efficient scheduling methods of RC-GA, AMTS, and E-PAGA, the proposed solution helps to reduce significant energy consumption and improve performance by 5%--20% with deadline constraint satisfied.},

	abstract = {In a cloud-based cyber--physical system, many jobs consist of multiple parallel tasks. The cloud system usually adopts active task replication to improve performance and guarantee the reliability of a job. This technology creates redundant replicas for each task and then executes the replicas concurrently. In the cloud system, each replica is a virtual machine (VM) image that can be easily assigned to different physical machines (PMs) to overcome resource heterogeneity. However, how to design a rational task replication strategy (including replica creation and VM assignment) is indeed a complex issue. It should comprehensively consider correlations and tradeoffs among reliability, performance, and energy consumption. This paper first proposes a reliability--performance correlation model for a job executed by using active task replication. We design a general method to avoid analyzing complex failure correlations and give a Bayesian approach to calculate the performability metric of the job. The paper also proposes a reliability--energy correlation model to evaluate random energy consumption of a PM hosting multiple VMs by using mixed random variables. Finally, an expected net profit optimization model and a genetic algorithm are developed to search for an optimal task replication strategy balancing tradeoffs among reliability, performance, and energy consumption. Illustrative examples are provided.},

Users benefit from the pay-as-you-go model by saving expenditures and service providers are deploying their services to cloud data centers to reduce their maintenance efforts. However, due to the fast growth of cloud data centers, the energy consumed by the data centers can lead to a huge amount of carbon emission with environmental impacts, and the carbon intensity of different locations are varied among different power plants according to the sources of energy. Thus, in this paper, to address the carbon emission problem of data centers, we consider shifting the workloads among multi-cloud located in different time zones. We also formulate the energy usage and carbon emission of data centers and model the solar power corresponding to the locations. This helps to reduce the usage of brown energy and maximize the utilization of renewable energy at different locations. We propose an approach for managing carbon footprint and renewable energy for multiple data centers at California, Virginia, and Dublin, which are in different time zones. The results show that our proposed approaches that apply workload shifting can reduce around 40% carbon emission in comparison to the baseline while ensuring the average response time of user requests.},

ICTs have a fundamental role in collaborating for a sustainable development by providing services in an efficient way, however, its own structure should also follow sustainable principles, for instance, by consuming lower energy amount. The quest for sustainability of ICTs has been focused on data centers (DC) optimization through techniques of sharing infra-structures, which would result in energy efficiency increase, carbon footprint reduction, and reduction of e-waste material disposal. In this scenario, the cloud computing technique rises as the most promising one, often receiving the ``green'' label. However, this label is usually based on electricity consumption reduction and disregards several other important ``green'' label-related aspects. This work uses emergy accounting (spelled with an ``m'') and direct energy consumption in calculating indicators of eco-energy efficiency for DC operating under traditional and cloud computing techniques. A traditional decentralized DC and a centralized cloud computing DC are herein considered for illustrating figures and for discussion. Results show that centralized DC is able to provide a virtual machine (VM) by demanding 51% less electricity than decentralized DC, and it consumes 87% less electricity to store a byte. Under an emergy accounting perspective, the centralized DC demands 45% less global resources than the decentralized DC to provide a VM while demanding 85% less global resources to store a byte. Although the assessed indicators point out better eco-energy efficiency performance for the DC using cloud computing techniques, labeling it as ``green'' could be considered as premature due to a lack of threshold which allows for categorizing a system as ``green''. Nevertheless, the centralized DC evaluated should be promoted due to its better performance as for the considered indicators.},

Here, we focus on the Cloud virtual machine (VM) scheduling that is usually based on simple algorithms, e.g. VM placement on nodes with low memory usage. This approach fails to consider the actual configuration of nodes inside the server rack resulting in local overheating of Cloud data centres. To solve this, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the gravitational effect, called VMSAGE, to optimize energy efficiency of Cloud computing systems. Inspired by the physical gravitation model, we define the thermal repulsion and logical gravitation factors between physical nodes and VMs. To achieve optimized VM scheduling, we propose a gravitation function that refers to the calculation of the logical quality of each VM, host and rack through the algorithm, so as to draw the attractiveness between them. Based on the concept of dimension reduction, VMSAGE conducts the two-dimensional plane target selection twice to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, VMSAGE evaluates attributes of the computer room to carry out the VM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution, we compare it with the Best Fit Heuristic (BFH) and the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithm achieves 10% and 20% optimized energy consumption respectively. The experimental results highlight our contribution, in where VMSAGE can significantly reduce energy consumption rates and VM migration times.},

	abstract = {The workload of cloud providers is often uncertain due to the dynamic and varied client demands, thus presenting a significant challenge. If cloud providers fail to meet changing demands during peak hours, they may experience service requests' delays and rejections, damaging both their reputation and their profit margin. The idea of cloud federations is contemplated as a solution to this challenge by allowing a group of cloud providers to combine their resources, as and when required, to satisfy client requests dynamically. Despite the merits of the existing cloud federation approaches, they suffer from several limitations, such as performance issues, the inability to converge to a solution in complex scenarios, the lack of consideration of SLA requirements during the federation formation phase, and the lack of flexibility offered to clients to prioritize specific objectives during the formation of the cloud federation. This work addresses these deficiencies by presenting a green, practical, and customizable SLA-based approach to cloud federation formation. Inspired by social gaming, the proposed approach can rapidly form a stable coalition of cloud providers able to fulfill client requests, while ensuring the satisfaction of SLA requirements in terms of performance, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and providers' trustfulness. At the heart of this approach lies a new coalition formation algorithm, dubbed the ``multi-criterion coalition formation algorithm (MCCF).'' Unlike existing collation formation algorithms, the MCCF algorithm offers clients the flexibility to prioritize the objectives used for cloud federation formation. Based on those preferences, the MCCF algorithm generates stable SLA-aware groups of cloud providers that dynamically adapt to network changes using a self-healing process. The MCCF algorithm has been implemented and extensively tested using a wide range of scenarios, and its performance was compared with that of two state of the art approaches: The optimal approach and the split-and-merge approach. The results show that the MCCF algorithm outperforms the optimal and the split-and-merge approaches in terms of coalition size, individual providers' payoff, and mistrust cost. Moreover, the proposed approach yields a zero % request rejection rate and an execution time that is 8 to 16 times faster than the split-and-merge and optimal approaches, while enabling a reduction of the Carbon footprint of the cloud coalition operations. Owing to these advantages and its ability to offer a flexible and customizable solution to clients, the MCCF algorithm represents a promising and environmentally conscious cloud collation formation approach that is ideal for real-time applications and practical cloud deployments.},

	abstract = {Load balancing, in Cloud Computing (CC) environment, is defined as the method of splitting workloads and computing properties. It enables the enterprises to manage workload demands or application demands by distributing the resources among computers, networks or servers. In this research article, a new load balancing algorithm is proposed as a hybrid of firefly and Improved Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (IMPSO) technique, abbreviated as FIMPSO. This technique deploys Firefly (FF) algorithm to minimize the search space where as the IMPSO technique is implemented to identify the enhanced response. The IMPSO algorithm works by selecting the global best (gbest) particle with a small distance of point to a line. With the application of minimum distance from a point to a line, the gbest particle candidates could be elected. The proposed FIMPSO algorithm achieved effective average load for making and enhanced the essential measures like proper resource usage and response time of the tasks. The simulation outcome showed that the proposed FIMPSO model exhibited an effective performance when compared with other methods. From the simulation outcome, it is understood that the FIMPSO algorithm yielded an effective result with the least average response time of 13.58ms, maximum CPU utilization of 98%, memory utilization of 93%, reliability of 67% and throughput of 72% along with a make span of 148, which was superior to all the other compared methods.},

@article{LI2012379,
	abstract = {As the sizes of IT infrastructure continue to grow, cloud computing is a natural extension of virtualisation technologies that enable scalable management of virtual machines over a plethora of physically connected systems. The so-called virtualisation-based cloud computing paradigm offers a practical approach to green IT/clouds, which emphasise the construction and deployment of scalable, energy-efficient network software applications (NetApp) by virtue of improved utilisation of the underlying resources. The latter is typically achieved through increased sharing of hardware and data in a multi-tenant cloud architecture/environment and, as such, accentuates the critical requirement for enhanced security services as an integrated component of the virtual infrastructure management strategy. This paper analyses the key security challenges faced by contemporary green cloud computing environments, and proposes a virtualisation security assurance architecture, CyberGuarder, which is designed to address several key security problems within the `green' cloud computing context. In particular, CyberGuarder provides three different kinds of services; namely, a virtual machine security service, a virtual network security service and a policy based trust management service. Specifically, the proposed virtual machine security service incorporates a number of new techniques which include (1) a VMM-based integrity measurement approach for NetApp trusted loading, (2) a multi-granularity NetApp isolation mechanism to enable OS user isolation, and (3) a dynamic approach to virtual machine and network isolation for multiple NetApp's based on energy-efficiency and security requirements. Secondly, a virtual network security service has been developed successfully to provide an adaptive virtual security appliance deployment in a NetApp execution environment, whereby traditional security services such as IDS and firewalls can be encapsulated as VM images and deployed over a virtual security network in accordance with the practical configuration of the virtualised infrastructure. Thirdly, a security service providing policy based trust management is proposed to facilitate access control to the resources pool and a trust federation mechanism to support/optimise task privacy and cost requirements across multiple resource pools. Preliminary studies of these services have been carried out on our iVIC platform, with promising results. As part of our ongoing research in large-scale, energy-efficient/green cloud computing, we are currently developing a virtual laboratory for our campus courses using the virtualisation infrastructure of iVIC, which incorporates the important results and experience of CyberGuarder in a practical context.},

In addition, the emerging concept of Cloud federation allows providers to optimize the utilization of their resources establishing business partnerships. In this scenario, the massive exploitation of ICT solutions is increasing the energy consumption of providers, thus many researchers are currently investigating new energy management strategies. Nevertheless, balancing Quality of Service (QoS) with both energy sustainability and cost saving concepts is not trivial at all. The growing interest in this area has been highlighted by the increasing number of contributions that are appearing in literature. Currently, most of energy management strategies are specifically focused on independent Cloud providers, others are beginning to look at Cloud federation. In this paper, we present a survey that helps researchers to identify the future trends of energy management in Cloud federation. In particular, we select the major contributions dealing with energy sustainability and cost-saving strategies aimed at Cloud computing and federation and we present a taxonomy useful to analyze the current state-of-the-art. In the end, we highlight possible directions for future research efforts.},

@article{MCDONNELL2020288,
	abstract = {Cloud computing has seen rapid growth in the last decade, as a result of this there is an increasing concern about the energy requirement of cloud data centres. One approach to tackle this issue is dynamic virtual machine consolidation (DVMC) where virtual machines (VMs) are packed into fewer hosts, while hosts which have no VMs are placed into a hibernate mode. DVMC is traditionally solved with strategies that build on centralised topologies. One disadvantage of these solutions is that they don′t scale well in very large data centres as the manager node becomes a bottleneck and a single point of failure. The nature of the problem lends itself to a decentralised solution which is preferred over a centralised one when a problem is: inherently modular, large in scale, in a very dynamic environment, and when communication channels can experience message delays and loss. We propose Gossip Contracts (GC), a new multi-agent framework for crafting decentralised co-operation strategies. GC is inspired by the Gossip and Contract Net protocols. Using GC we developed a GC-based DVMC strategy and compared it to two popular strategies: Sercon, a centralised strategy, and ecoCloud, a distributed strategy. One of the comparison experiments uses Google cluster-usage traces; a dataset of real usage data from a Google data centre. The GC-based strategy performs best with respect to SLA Violations, and is similar to or outperforms other strategies with respect to power consumption. By its decentralised nature, GC does not have a single point of failure.},

Another reason behind excessive need of data centers is because of increasing number of internet users. Increasing demand of data centers simultaneously need huge amount of energy for data center operation and on other end emit enormous amount of CO2. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce energy consumption, but major concern is by looking at one parameter or criteria they must compromise on other. Our proposed approach MIPS-Aware VM Placement in combination with searching of best capable host helps to reduce VM migration and increase mean time for better performance and save energy. Proposed approach identifies overloaded and underloaded hosts and to improve system performance algorithm does not allow to allocate additional workload, which will also help to reduce energy and get better QoS. Proposed approach significantly decreases VM migration and increase mean time before VM migration which in turns helps to reduce energy and associated cost. By using proposed MIPS-Aware VM Placement approach, we can reduce upto 25% more energy consumption compared to traditional approaches.},

In this paper, a hardware and software collaborative optimization strategy is implemented to minimize the energy cost while satisfying the time constraint of the cloud-computing datacenters. In the hardware aspect, a DVFS-capable CPU/GPU/FPGA heterogeneous cloud infrastructure is built. This infrastructure has high flexibility, and can adjust its hardware characteristics dynamically in terms of the software run-time contexts, so that a hardware platform which matches the software can be built. Based on this hardware platform, the cloud applications can be executed more efficiently with less energy cost. In the software aspect, the deadline-aware energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms are investigated. Different from the traditional approaches which search for the optimal scheduling solution by the heuristic approaches, a new scheduling approach based on the improved Mathematical Morphology (MM) algorithm is investigated in this paper. To evaluate the performance of our work, we calculated the energy cost of the Fourier transform (FT) and Gaussian elimination (GE) applications on the homogeneous and heterogeneous cloud computing platforms by applying the GA and MM algorithms, respectively. The results proved the MM algorithms running on the DVFS-capable heterogeneous cloud infrastructure could decrease the energy cost of the FT application and GE application respectively by 24.7% and 37.8%, if compared with the GA algorithm running on the DVFS-incapable homogeneous cloud infrastructure.},

As such, the VM placement strategy does not take into account the impact it produces on the network performance in terms of quality of service parameters such as packet losses and traffic delays. The proposed strategy allows cloud providers to reach a balance between the energy efficiency of their infrastructures and the network quality of service they offer to their customers.

One way to tackle this problem is from a software perspective. If it were known which software changes influenced energy consumption, then tools could be created to help software professionals create more energy efficient software. The process of extracting energy consumption information, Green Mining, is time demanding because researchers must run many tests, with sufficient coverage, on each revision in a software product multiple times. The time required for testing acts as a barrier to extracting energy consumption measurements from new software systems. Therefore, this work proposes, implements, and evaluates a search-based approximation method that trades some precision for a speed-up in the mining process. This speed-up enables researchers to study additional software systems that were too costly to investigate before.},

Nowadays Cloud networks and data centers consume a lot of energy. In order to decrease energy consumption like heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms are in wide range of use in this problem because a Virtual Machine(VM) consolidation is considered a NP-hard problem. Ant colony system, artificial bee colony, genetic algorithm and local regression are some of these heuristic methods. These mentioned algorithms tried to maintain service level agreement (SLA) while reducing energy consumption and live migrations. On the other hand, the harmony search algorithm has acceptable convergence rate compared to swarm methods, and has less computation time compared to genetic algorithm to find the optimum answer. In this paper, we are motivated to use newly presented meta-heuristic harmony search algorithm. This algorithm has proven its efficiency in power management systems. This algorithm benefits in way that other particle and genetic driven algorithms don't. Some of these benefits are faster result, no need for initial parameters, and no need for data derivation. Using this algorithm for virtual machine consolidation allows reduction in energy consumption, SLA violation, live migrations quantity and energy SLA violation multiplication (ESV), where the proposed method has proven its efficiency and offered improvement ranges from minimum of 18.56% in ESV to maximum of 1988.23% in migrations compared to previous methods.},

With the advancement in Cloud services, the issue of carbon dioxide emission becomes significant. There is also a challenge for Cloud provider to satisfy the customer by guaranteeing the services with performance and availability in Service Level Agreement (SLA). Hence, energy consumption and SLA violation become important issues for Cloud providers. These issues can be addressed in many facets viz. efficient provisioning of resources, reducing energy consumption in datacenters, server consolidation, virtual machine (VM) migration, minimizing SLA violation or also by providing SLA with green requirements. In this paper, we survey various techniques which address green SLA with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements by using different resource management and consolidation procedures.Further, we propose our work by considering the multi-criteria method for resource management which selects the host as probable migration destination having highest predicted utilization after allocating a VM on the host. Hence, we aim to address the issue of maintaining the trade-off between energy consumption and SLA violation.},

	abstract = {A promising avenue to control energy-related costs in enterprise data centers is to investigate power-aware resource management strategies. Mechanisms to accurately capture energy consumption in data centers include source and machine code instruction analysis, kernel sensors, system call monitors and per-VM metering techniques. Though very accurate, these approaches are highly invasive, requiring modifications to software or hardware, and introduce an observer effect that can adversely impact performance. Perhaps most important, results obtained from these approaches require refinement before they can actually be used for management decisions that must strike a balance between costs, SLOs and SLAs. Using existing instrumentation at a rack's PDU provides sufficient granularity to determine the true energy consumption of servers in a non-intrusive way. We show that by leveraging existing instrumentation at a rack's PDU, profiling the type of resource (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network) a process is using on a given server is not only possible, but highly accurate despite the anticipated signal noise from other servers on a rack's power circuit. This provides a better foundation and allows us to forecast and manage energy demands in data centers.},

While a sig- nificant body of research exists to measure, monitor, and control the greenness level of hardware components, signif- icant research efforts are needed to relate hardware energy consumption to energy consumption due to program exe- cution. In this paper we report on our investigations to characterize power consumption profiles for different types of compute and memory intensive software applications. In particular, we focus on studying the effects of CPU loads on the power consumption of compute servers by monitoring rack power consumption in a data center. We conducted a series of experiments with a variety of processes of differ- ent complexity to understand and characterize the effect on power consumption. Combining processes of varying com- plexity with varying resource allocations produces different energy consumption levels. The challenge is to optimize pro- cess orchestration based on a power consumption framework to accrue energy savings. Our ultimate goal is to develop smart adaptive green computing techniques, such as adap- tive job scheduling and resource provisioning, to reduce over- all power consumption in data centers or clouds.},

	abstract = {Digital information management is the key enabler for unprecedented rise in productivity and efficiency gains experienced by the world economies during the 21st century. Information processing systems have thus become essential to the functioning of business, service, academic, and governmental institutions. As institutions increase their offerings of digital information services, the demand for computation and storage capability also increases. Examples include online banking, e-filing of taxes, music and video downloads, online shipment tracking, real-time inventory/supply-chain management, electronic medical recording, insurance database management, surveillance and disaster recovery. It is estimated that, in some industries, the number of records that must be retained is growing at a CAGR of 50 percent or greater. This exponential increase in the digital intensity of human existence is driven by many factors, including ease of use and availability of a rich set of information technology (IT) devices and services. Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine how significant societal transformations that better our world could occur without the productivity and innovation enabled by the IT. Unfortunately, the energy cost and carbon footprint of the IT devices and services has become exorbitant. Moreover, current technological and digital service utilization trends result in a doubling of the energy cost of the IT infrastructure and its carbon footprint in less than five years. In an energy-constrained world, this consumption trend is unsustainable and comes at increasingly unacceptable societal and environmental costs. This presentation will first explain what is meant by green computing and how greenness of information processing may be quantified. Next, energy-efficient computing paradigms which utilize chip multi-processing, multiple-voltage domains, dynamic voltage/frequency scaling, and power/clock gating techniques will be reviewed. Finally, techniques for improving performance per Watt of large-scale information processing and storage systems (e.g., a data center), including hierarchical dynamic power management, task placement and scheduling, energy balancing, resource virtualization, and application optimizations that dynamically configure hardware for higher efficiency will be discussed.},

Each data center consumes electricity for its un-interrupted operations and maintenance, therefore responsible for the emissions of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas causing climate change. Hence, there is a necessity to provide a solution through which energy consumption for cloud data centers can be reduced. As virtual machine located in data center are run under loaded to maintain higher performance but it causes wastage of resources and power. While, task overloading severally reduce the performance of data center. To address this issue, we propose CMBA (Cluster and Migration Based Approach) for cloud resource allocation that maps groups of tasks to customized virtual machine types based on processing, memory and network requirements. Proper placement of workload with specific VMs and dynamic migration concept reduce energy consumption for running physical machine and its respective host or data centers. Taking altogether, intelligent customization of virtual machines by adopting CMBA approach will maintain high efficiency of datacenters with reduced energy consumption.},

Typically, tasks are submitted to such a cloud computing server in an online fashion, and the server operator has to schedule the tasks and decides on payments without knowledge about the tasks arriving in the future. Although very natural, this cloud computing problem on speed-scalable processors has not been studied from a mechanism design perspective in the online setting.We provide a mechanism for this setting, both for a single and multiprocessor environment, that has several desirable properties: (1) the induced game admits a subgame perfect equilibrium in pure strategies and therefore a pure Nash equilibrium, (2) the Price of Anarchy is constant, (3) the mechanism is budget balanced, i.e., the sum of the payments of the agents is equal to the total energy costs, (4) the communication complexity is low, (5) the mechanism is computationally tractable for both the service operator and the agents, and (6) the agents' payment is also intuitive and easy to communicate to them. We also provide a second mechanism with a better Price of Anarchy, which in turn is more involved to implement.We are able to extend our mechanisms and results to the Bayesian setting, where the type of each agent is drawn independently from some underlying distribution and agents are minimizing their expected costs. In this setting we also show the same approximation factor of our mechanism as in the basic online setting in both the single and the multiprocessor environment.},

	abstract = {Data centers have recently gained significant popularity as a cost-effective platform for hosting large-scale service applications. While large data centers enjoy economies of scale by amortizing initial capital investment over large number of machines, they also incur tremendous energy cost in terms of power distribution and cooling. An effective approach for saving energy in data centers is to adjust dynamically the data center capacity by turning off unused machines. However, this dynamic capacity provisioning problem is known to be challenging as it requires a careful understanding of the resource demand characteristics as well as considerations to various cost factors, including task scheduling delay, machine reconfiguration cost and electricity price fluctuation.In this paper, we provide a control-theoretic solution to the dynamic capacity provisioning problem that minimizes the total energy cost while meeting the performance objective in terms of task scheduling delay. Specifically, we model this problem as a constrained discrete-time optimal control problem, and use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to find the optimal control policy. Through extensive analysis and simulation using real workload traces from Google's compute clusters, we show that our proposed framework can achieve significant reduction in energy cost, while maintaining an acceptable average scheduling delay for individual tasks.},

	abstract = {Global warming, which is currently one of the greatest environmental challenges, is caused by carbon emissions. A report from the Energy Information Administration indicates that approximately 98% of CO2 emissions can be attributed to energy consumption. The trade-off between efficient and ecologically sound operation represents a major challenge faced by many organizations at present. In addition, numerous companies are currently compelled to pay a carbon tax for the resources they use and the environmental impact of their products and services. Therefore, an energy consumption system can generate actual financial payback. Green information technology involves various approaches, including power management, recycling, telecommunications, and virtualization. This paper focuses on comparing and evaluating techniques used for reducing energy consumption in virtualized environments. We first highlight the impact of virtualization techniques on minimizing energy consumption in cloud computing. Then we present an experimental comparative study between two common energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms in cloud computing (i.e., the green scheduler, the power saver scheduler). These algorithms are discussed briefly and analyzed. The three metrics used to evaluate the task scheduling algorithms are (1) total power consumption, (2) data center load, and (3) virtual machine load. This work aims to gauge and subsequently improve energy consumption efficiency in virtualized environments.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of resource allocation in a large-scale cloud environment, which we formalize as that of dynamically optimizing a cloud configuration for green computing objectives under CPU and memory constraints. We propose a generic gossip protocol for resource allocation, which can be instantiated for specific objectives. We develop an instantiation of this generic protocol which aims at minimizing power consumption through server consolidation, while satisfying a changing load pattern. This protocol, called GRMP-Q, provides an efficient heuristic solution that performs well in most cases---in special cases it is optimal. Under overload, the protocol gives a fair allocation of CPU resources to clients. Simulation results suggest that key performance metrics do not change with increasing system size, making the resource allocation process scalable to well above 100,000 servers. Generally, the effectiveness of the protocol in achieving its objective increases with increasing memory capacity in the servers.},

	abstract = {When considering hardware platforms, not just time to solution can be of importance but also the energy necessary to reach it. This is not only the case with battery powered mobile devices but also with HPC cluster systems due to financial and practical limits on power consumption a nd cooling. With a variety of hardware options available, the question arises which combination of devices is best suited for a given problem. The answer depends not only on the runtime but also on the energy to solution and the price of the hardware. The energy required to reach a solution becomes increasingly important as battery powered systems have to handle computationally intensive tasks e.g. image processing or machine learning. Even for data centers or HPC facilities the energy cost over the lifetime of the systems can be higher than the acquisition cost. To showcase the differences and give a basic outlook on the applicability of different architectures, devices ranging from ARM systems to server CPUs and GPUs have been used with diverse benchmarking test cases taken from applied research applications.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is the latest buzz in most of the IT organizations which are witnessing a a trend of migration from traditional computing to cloud computing, thereby reducing their infrastructure cost and improving efficiency and performance. Cloud computing provides services through virtualization layer, which helps to execute more than one operating systems and applications on a single machine. Being a crucial part of cloud computing, virtualization layer faces major security threats, most challenging being an insider threat wherein attacker can either compromise existing virtual machines (VMs) or create rogue VMs. The objective of this work is to propose virtual machine (VM) allocation algorithm which operates in an untrusted cloud computing environment with non-trustworthy VMs. Our approach is based on the notion of trust. Lack of trust is modeled by either introducing faults or monitoring SLAs per host on which VMs are hosted. Detailed experiments considering varying cloud infrastructure and varying workloads are conducted using CloudSim. Results show that proposed algorithm works well in untrusted environment while at the same time is energy efficient and reduces the computational costs by decreasing the number of migrations and SLA violations.},

The aim of cloud service providers is to reduce the operational costs by minimizing energy consumption while providing competitive services to their customers.

	abstract = {The global growth of cloud computing services is rising abruptly due to a large variety of services like computing, storage, network, etc. It expresses cloud service providers (CSPs) for better usage of existing datacenter resources, increasing agility, and reducing the need for unanticipated datacenter growth. These datacenters use a lot of energy generated from fossil fuels (i.e., non-renewable energy (NRE) sources) and omit a lot of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, which cause the greenhouse effect and are harmful to the environment. Moreover, NRE sources are limited in supply and cannot be sustained over a long period. As a circumstance, CSPs are moving towards renewable energy (RE) sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, to decarbonize datacenters even though these resources are not available round the clock. Therefore, recent studies focus on using both RE and NRE sources to avoid any interruption of the datacenter services. However, these studies consider the equal cost for all the RE sources and do not consider the categorization among user requests (URs). This paper considers the different costs for RE sources and two categories of URs, namely critical and non-critical, and introduces a cost-variant RE-based scheduling (CRES) algorithm for cloud computing. Here, the critical UR does not depend on the RE resources due to the unpredictability of RE sources. On the other hand, the non-critical UR can be accommodated by both RE and NRE resources. We simulate the proposed algorithm by considering 20 to 100 URs and 5 to 25 datacenters and compare the performance with the future-aware best fit (FABEF) and highest available renewable first (HAREF) algorithms in terms of cost and usage count of RE resources to show its usefulness.},

	abstract = {This paper explores technologies to achieve low-latency energy-efficient communications in Global-Scale Cloud Computing systems. A global-scale cloud computing system linking 100 remote data-centers can interconnect potentially 5M servers, considerably larger than the size of traditional High-Performance-Computing (HPC) machines. Traditional HPC machines use tightly coupled processors and networks which rarely drop packets. In contrast, today's IP Internet is a relatively loosely-coupled Best-Effort network with poor latency and energy-efficiency guarantees, with relatively high packet loss rates. This paper explores the use of a recently-proposed Future-Internet network, which uses a QoS-aware router scheduling algorithm combined with a new IETF resource reservation signalling technology, to achieve improved latency and energy-efficiency in cloud computing systems. A Maximum-Flow Minimum-Energy routing algorithm is used to route high-capacity "trunks" between data-centers distributed over the continental USA, using a USA IP network topology. The communications between virtual machines in remote data-centers are aggregated and multiplexed onto the trunks, to achieve significantly improved energy-efficiency. According to theory and simulations, the large and variable queueing delays of traditional Best-Effort Internet links can be eliminated, and the latency over the cloud can be reduced to near-minimal values, i.e., the fiber latency. The maximum fiber latencies over the Sprint USA network are approx. 20 milliseconds, comparable to hard disk drive latencies, and multithreading in virtual machines can be used to hide these latencies. Furthermore, if existing dark-fiber over the continental network is activated, the bisection bandwidth available in a global-scale cloud computing system can rival that achievable in commercial HPC machines.},

This paper also proposes a formal method to calculate the finishing time of tasks running in a failure prone cloud computing environment using checkpointing and without checkpointing. To achieve the objective of maximizing the reliability and minimizing the energy-consumption of cloud computing systems, three resource provisioning and virtual machine (VM) allocation policies using the aforementioned mathematical models are proposed. These three policies are named Reliability Aware Best Fit Decreasing (RABFD), Energy Aware Best Fit Decreasing (EABFD), Reliability-Energy Aware Best Fit Decreasing (REABFD). A simulation based evaluation of the proposed policies has been done by using real failure traces and workload models.

	abstract = {Minimizing power consumption is a vital consideration in the modern-day development of cloud computing. One of the major challenges reported in cloud computing is the consumption of power by computing resources due to improper allocation of resources over improperly sized virtual machines (VM). In spite of many efforts, the existing solutions are only able to meet the requirement for minimizing power consumption to a limited extent, due to their lack of optimized allocation of computing resources. The primary aim of the proposed work is to make effective use of the computing resources of the cloud for minimizing power consumption. It employs the concept of mapping appropriately sized VMs to a group of tasks in a data center, in order to reduce its power consumption. It involves the clustering of tasks on the basis of their computing requirements and finding a suitably sized VM with the required computing resources. The efficient use of computing resources on the basis of their actual requirements for a group of tasks helps to save a substantial amount of power. The proposed work is evaluated for its superiority over representational techniques using Google cloud traces as benchmark dataset. The experimental results showed an improvement of 8.42% in power consumption compared to representational techniques using fixed-sized VMs in the field. The proposed approach also achieves an improvement of 62% in the number of instances of VMs created for hosting the task workload, while maintaining a low task rejection rate.},

However, such great significance comes with the support of a great infrastructure that includes large data centers comprising thousands of server units and other supporting equipment. Their share in power consumption generates between 1.1% and 1.5% of the total electricity use worldwide and is projected to rise even more. Such alarming numbers demand rethinking the energy efficiency of such infrastructures. However, before making any changes to infrastructure, an analysis of the current status is required. In this article, we perform a comprehensive analysis of an infrastructure supporting the cloud computing paradigm with regards to energy efficiency. First, we define a systematic approach for analyzing the energy efficiency of most important data center domains, including server and network equipment, as well as cloud management systems and appliances consisting of a software utilized by end users. Second, we utilize this approach for analyzing available scientific and industrial literature on state-of-the-art practices in data centers and their equipment.

	abstract = {As individuals and researchers approach the challenge of green computing it is natural to consider the energy consumption of computational devices and their supporting systems during their use phase (i.e., after they are deployed into service). This includes reducing energy consumption in processors, memory systems, peripheral devices, cooling systems and a host of other components that are used in deployed systems. However, for computing to be truly green, all phases of the system life-cycle, from manufacturing to disposal, must be considered. In particular there is limited awareness to the considerable fraction of the total life-cycle environmental impacts of computing systems that result from the fabrication of the integrated circuits (ICs) that are used in those devices. Studies have shown that the energy and environmental costs of IC fabrication can actually significantly outpace use-phase sustainability metrics and environmental impacts. With trends towards more exotic, thus, more environmentally unfriendly, fabrication approaches at deeply scaled nodes, life-cycle thinking for next generation computing systems that includes traditional optimization of operational energy-efficiency as well as minimizing impacts from IC fabrication is critical. In this talk I will present a new cadre of tools and methodologies to holistically evaluate energy consumption and other environmental impacts from computing. Based on these tools, I will discuss new interdisciplinary research directions and educational opportunities that emerge towards achieving more sustainable computing.},

	abstract = {Energy storage plays a key element to use new energy to replace traditional coal and petrochemical energy, and it plays an important role of shifting energy utilization ways. Nowadays energy internet is a way of renewable and sharing energy. A cloud platform for monitoring energy information of thermal storage systems is developed by using cloud computing, IoT and energy storage technologies. This platform allows a user to monitor the running conditions of regional thermal energy systems in real-time from anywhere as the condition data are synchronized to the client-side website, and data are stored into a data storage server. To quickly locate any thermal energy storage system, the geographical locations of the systems built anywhere are marked on the map of the web page. The condition data of all systems can be collected and communicated between the control unit installed in the heat system and the servers on cloud. The gathered data can be worked out for further allocating energy consumption. This platform has been launched after successfully tested on a number of practical thermal energy storage systems at different regions. This will provide a guarantee for further intelligent analysis and optimization of energy deployment.},

	abstract = {Sustainable computing is a rapidly growing research area spanning several areas of computer science. In the software engineering field, the topic has received increasing attention in recent years, with several studies addressing a range of concerns. However, few studies have demonstrated the awareness of software practitioners about the underlying concepts of sustainability in the software development practice. In this effect, in this study, we aim to provide some evidence about the practitioners' perception about the adoption of sustainability in software development, under four main perspectives: economic, social, environmental and technical. To accomplish such a goal, we carried out a survey study with twenty-five software engineers involved in projects in different domains. The yielded results indicate an overall lack of knowledge about the topic, in particular regarding the concepts about sustainable software, although it is a common understanding that sustainability should be treated as a quality attribute and should support the interaction between sustainability and the software development life cycle phases. Among the observed perspectives, the respondents indicate that the technical dimension is the most relevant and explored so far. This study contributes to the field with initial evidence and can be seen as a first step towards establishing a common understanding about how the software industry is receptive to the use of sustainability concepts in software development practices.},

The traditional theoretical research for speed scaling usually assume the power function as the form Sα. Moreover, more comprehensive support for Quality of Service (QoS) is essential by cloud computing providers. Thus, how to dealing with the power/performance trade-off is a burning question. Motivated by improving energy efficiency of the data center, we study policies by setting the speed of the processor for both goals of minimizing the total energy cost and meeting the specified QoS performance well. We initiate a model of speed scaling with weighted power energy, the QoS parameters can be induced to a qualitative concept as the weighting factor of energy consumptions. Based on this model, we propose a resource allocation policy based on the cooperative game theory for energy-efficient management of clouds. The simulation results show the efficiency of the method.},

Employing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study therefore set out to examine the influence of factors such as attitude, social influence, media influence, perceived behavioral control and environmental concern on the IT worker's green computing intention. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 149 respondents within a large financial services firm in Gauteng. Descriptive statistics suggest that personal awareness, knowledge and actual green computing behaviors are low. Regression analysis indicates that environmental concern, perceived behavioral control, attitude, and media influence are important predictors while social influence plays almost no role -- suggesting that IT workers are under no social pressure to practice green computing. The paper recommends that responsible peers, firms, higher education institutions, and media focus their attention on driving environmental awareness in order to promote green computing behaviors among seemingly unaware and disempowered IT workers.},

The stakeholders of GSS are detailed with the services each stakeholder can provide and consume, thus clarifying their interests to GSS. Based on this analysis, we present the domain-independent, high-level requirements to GSS that cover diverse needs of different stakeholders. Six business models are then proposed to promote collaborations of stakeholders on the delivery of GSS. In the end, the relationship between GSS and cloud is discussed and a GSS marketplace is envisioned.},

They were analyzed based on a set of classification criteria, including contribution types, SDLC phases, evidence types, research types, application domains, publication venues, distribution between academia and industry and research methods. The results indicated a growing interest by the SE research community in the Green and Sustainable software domain. Besides, there is an observed need for more studies on techniques, tools and metrics covering construction, testing and maintenance.

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides resources as services in pay-as-you-go mode to customers by using virtualization technology. As virtual machine (VM) is hosted on physical server, great energy is consumed by maintaining the servers in data center. More physical servers means more energy consumption and more money cost. Therefore, the VM placement (VMP) problem is significant in cloud computing. This paper proposes an approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve the VMP problem, named as ACO-VMP, so as to effectively use the physical resources and to reduce the number of running physical servers. The number of physical servers is the same as the number of the VMs at the beginning. Then the ACO approach tries to reduce the physical server one by one. We evaluate the performance of the proposed ACO-VMP approach in solving VMP with the number of VMs being up to 600. Experimental results compared with the ones obtained by the first-fit decreasing (FFD) algorithm show that ACO-VMP can solve VMP more efficiently to reduce the number of physical servers significantly, especially when the number of VMs is large.},

	abstract = {Network virtualization is being regarded as a promising technology to create an ecosystem for cloud computing applications. One critical issue in network virtualization technology is power-efficient virtual network embedding (PE-VNE), which deals with the physical resource allocation to virtual nodes and links of a virtual network while minimizing the energy consumption in the cloud data center. When the node and link constraints (including CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and network delay) are both taken into account, the VN embedding problem is NP-hard, even in the offline case. This paper aims to investigate the ability of the Ant-Colony-Optimization (ACO) technique in handling PE-VNE problem. We propose an ACO-based heuristic PE-VNE algorithm, called E-ACO. E-ACO minimizes the energy consumption by considering the embedding power consumption in the node mapping phase and by making an implicit coordination between the node and link mapping phases. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and investigate different energy-aware link embedding algorithms on the ability of E-ACO.},

	abstract = {Achieving energy-efficient Green operations within data centers used for applications such as Cloud Computing requires matching the power consumed to the data processed at each server in real-time. Beyond having a high efficiency in the server power supplies, it is vitally important to only draw power when the server is actually processing data. To operate at maximum energy efficiency, in the times when a server is idle it needs to draw no power for the server farm. By matching power draw to actual data processing activity at logic speeds, the average energy draw of the server farm drops by 50% or more with no reduction in throughput. Drawing on technology developed for efficient radio transmitters, an agile power supply, able to provide tight voltage regulation and still transition between power-off and power-on (or the other way) in nanoseconds without transition overshoot is described. With this nanosecond agility, this also solves the objective for elastic computing. Additionally, the supply pin pairing required by this energy management method provides benefits toward reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI). Proportional reduction in processor operating temperature improves reliability, along with reducing facility cooling loads.},

Hardware and software manufacturers are beginning to include power saving options in a range of products from processors to operating systems (OS). Previous work on power saving has focused mainly on OS control of the operating modes of laptop computers and mobile devices to maximize battery life. To take full advantage of these newly available energy saving features, we have developed a power management agent with a set of power control and monitoring interfaces which allows power saving features to be implemented on individual applications. We call these power saving capable applications Green Applications.In this demonstration, we will discuss and show a web based Green Application which implements these newly introduced power saving features. This application runs on an IBM HS20 Blade Server with Linux OS and equipped with a processor (Intel Xeon 3 GHz) capable of power management. When the application runs, it continuously adjusts the power level (range from standby to maximum) of the server processor in accordance with the state and performance requirements of the application (expressed as policies or static user-defined control parameters) via the power management agent. The power management agent can manage multiple Green Applications and can set the power level of the processor according to the aggregate power requirement of the applications. Using an advanced monitoring tool, the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) System [1], we will show graphically the dynamic interactions of the state and performance of the application, including processor temperature, CPU utilization, power cap, and power usage in a single integrated view, and present the amount of energy used in comparison with running the same application with no power saving features included.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces GREEN STREAMS, a novel solution to address a critical but often overlooked property of data-intensive software: energy efficiency. GREEN STREAMS is built around two key insights into data-intensive software. First, energy consumption of data-intensive software is strongly correlated to data volume and data processing, both of which are naturally abstracted in the stream programming paradigm; Second, energy efficiency can be improved if the data processing components of a stream program coordinate in a ``balanced'' way, much like an assembly line that runs most efficiently when participating workers coordinate their pace. GREEN STREAMS adopts a standard stream programming model, and applies Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to coordinate the pace of data processing among components, ultimately achieving energy efficiency without degrading performance in a parallel processing environment. At the core of GREEN STREAMS is a novel constraint-based inference to abstract the intrinsic relationships of data flow rates inside a stream program, that uses linear programming to minimize the frequencies -- hence the energy consumption -- for processing components while still maintaining the maximum output data flow rate. The core algorithm of GREEN STREAMS is formalized, and its optimality is established. The effectiveness of GREEN STREAMS is evaluated on top of the StreamIt framework, and preliminary results show the approach can save CPU energy by an average of 28% with a 7% performance improvement.},

	abstract = {It is axiomatic that a private Higher Education (HE) provider needs to focus on cost-effective and efficient ways to manage processes without compromising standards, quality and integrity. In order to ensure academic integrity, moderation of examinations is essential. Some of the challenges of the current system include a long turnaround period with regard to the moderation and return of scripts, high courier costs high printing volumes and the risks and costs involved in transporting original scripts.The private HE provider has therefore sought to find an alternative cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution to this question. The Faculty of Information Technology -- with the support of the moderators concerned -- became involved in a pilot study with reference to a proposed electronic moderation process.In this paper both the processes that worked, as well as those which did not, will be discussed. The outcome of the pilot study indicated that the proposed process definitely had a positive impact on the environment, budgetary limitations and security issues regarding examination scripts; it also allowed for better turnaround time of moderators' feedback and afforded moderators the opportunity to moderate at a time more convenient to themselves.},

	abstract = {Only recently has the software engineering community started conducting research on developing energy efficient software, or green software. This is shadowed when compared to the research already produced in the computer hardware community. While research in green software is rapidly increasing, several recent studies with software engineers show that they still miss techniques, knowledge, and tools to develop greener software. Indeed, all such studies suggest that green software should be part of a modern Computer Science Curriculum.In this paper, we present survey results from both researchers' and educators' perspective on green software education. These surveys confirm the lack of courses and educational material for teaching green software in current higher education. Additionally, we highlight three key pedagogical challenges in bringing green software to computer science curriculum and discussed existing solutions to address these key challenges. We firmly believe that 'green thinking" and the broad adoption of green software in computer science curriculum can greatly benefit our environment, society, and students in an era where software is everywhere and evolves in an unprecedented speed.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has become a very hot topic over the past few years. One of the main requirements in cloud computing environments is a high degree of automation for provisioning and dynamic management of IT resources (compute, storage and network resources) and services. Also, in cloud computing environments composed of large virtualized datacenters, energy consumption and carbon footprint have become major concerns which significantly impact resource management. This special issue is based on extended versions of the Green and Cloud Management workshop (CGM 2012) which focused on management and control issues related to dependability, scalabilitity, performance and configuration at each level of cloud computing infrastructures, but also on green computing issues in such environments such as energy efficiency, carbon footprint reduction and cooling. This raises the issue of management automation for multi-criteria optimization (including green metrics) at each level of a cloud environment. Topics of interest addressed by this special issue include: Monitoring for Green and Cloud computingControl algorithms and policies for Green and Cloud computingAutonomic Computing applyied to Green and Cloud ComputingDesign of energy efficient cloud stacksGreen-oriented Autonomic computingQoS and Green computing models for CloudsEnergy efficiency benchmarking and profiling for CloudsEnergy-aware configuration and resource management for CloudsComponent model for cloud and green computingSoftware engineering methodologies and tools for cloud and green computingScalability and reliability of management software for Green and Cloud computingReporting and exposing carbon and energy impactGreen architectures for Grids, Clouds and clustersDesign of green computing middlewareGreen-aware configuration and resource managementScheduling and control in green computingControl and optimization techniques for green computing Real life experiments.This issue gathers papers which focus on : (i) processors and routers management ranging from thermal awareness to power control and DVFS techniques, (ii) coarce grain control in the case of cloud infrastructures using discrete controller synthesis or neural predictor, (iii) fine grain energy profiler which can be used to understand the energy consumption of a software stack. We would like to thank the program committee members for their help during the reviewing process. We are also thankful to the OSR editors for their help about this special issue.We hope you will enjoy this special issue so that the presented papers will help you opening perspectives for your future researches.},

Research on green IT has already produced a variety of approaches aiming at reducing energy usage for data centers and technical equipment, such as computers, projectors, etc. Also methods have been proposed to improve energy efficiency of compilers and software. While focusing on code transformation, the software optimization methods frequently ignore operational features of target hardware and therefore have a limited effect in practice. In this talk we urge for software "greening" techniques that increase efficiency of energy reduction schemes of target hardware. The talk starts with a brief review of factors of energy consumption and main hardware schemes used in the state-of-the-art portable battery-operated devices. Then it discusses software optimizations for lowering energy consumption of CPU, memory, HDD, display, and communication. We argue that algorithm and software optimizations capable of improving computational and data efficiency, exploit adaptive, context-aware and quality-aware processing can all contribute to "green" applications. Open problems of "green" software development are also outlined.},

In this paper, we address the problem of federation formation for a set of CPs, whose solution is necessary to exploit the potential of cloud federations for the reduction of the energy bill. We devise an algorithm, based on cooperative game theory, that can be readily implemented in a distributed fashion, and that allows a set of CPs to cooperatively set up their federations in such a way that their individual profit is increased with respect to the case in which they work in isolation.We show that, by using our algorithm and the proposed CPs' utility function, they are able to self-organize into Nash-stable federations and, by means of iterated executions, to adapt themselves to environmental changes. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

This serves as an example of demand-sided smart energy application that copes with the challenges of big data analytic and real-time processing needs. The framework is based on the divide and conquer paradigm to accelerate data analytics with parallel computing. The workload is containerized and deployed on the Kubernetes cloud facility of our internationally collaborated IoTcloudServe@TEIN playground. With this playground, the workload scalability and portability can be achieved. Applying the proposed framework, this paper reports on a practical data log analysis to determine the wasted energy consumption. Based on the experimental result, the wasted energy consumption of the whole data set of CU-BEMS's communication research laboratory area from March 2014 to August 2017 can be computed within 81 seconds by using 32 cores running in parallel. The framework is expected to serve as a basis template for further research ongoing at CU-BEMS and smart energy applications that can be computationally enhanced by data analytic pipelining with containerized services as orchestrated by Kubernetes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, significant research has been conducted to boost the performance and increase the reliability of high performance computing (HPC) clusters. As the number of compute nodes in modern HPC clusters continues to grow, it is critical to design clusters with low power consumption and low failure rate. In particular, it is widely known that the internal disk drives of compute nodes (in the case of diskfull clusters) are a major source of failures. In addition, these diskfull HPC clusters tend to require more power and cooling requirements compared to diskless clusters. In this paper, we propose and implement a large-scale Infiniband-based diskless HPC cluster. The paper presents the cluster configuration and evaluates its performance using various High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmarks. The performance is measured in terms of the overall efficiency, speed in Giga-Floating Point Operations per Second (GFLOPS), and HPL execution time. We also measure temperature and power consumption. We compare the performance measurements of our diskless cluster to its diskfull counterpart. For our measurement and comparison, we consider three cluster sizes of 32, 64, and 126 compute nodes.},

	abstract = {Green computing is a catchall phrase that includes efforts to improve sustainability both within the IT industry and outside of it. The green IT movement seeks to reduce energy use, waste, and toxic substances by the IT industry. In many other industries, mobile and computing devices connected to the network enable sustainability through automation, virtualization, and reduced travel. Green computing is a topic of increasing importance within the IT industry. There are few green computing courses for undergraduates, and most are for advanced students. I present a "CS1 Lite" course centered on the theme of green computing. The course integrates programming activities with readings, discussion and online research. The first course module examined how the Internet and mobile networks enable sustainable practices, such as: the virtualization of goods and services, telecommuting and virtual meetings, and cloud computing. The second module examined the "Green IT" movement, including sustainability across the computer life cycle, and increasing energy efficiency, from individual computers up to data centers. The third module focused on "Smart Technology," where network-connected computing devices drive improvements. Topics included the smart energy grid, smart buildings, and applications in health care and agriculture. Throughout the course, programming assignments were tailored to problems relevant to the green computing topics. Students implemented simulations of green computing systems. Students exhibited increased interest and motivation for these projects, and learned naturally about data abstraction and computer networks.},

	abstract = {Cloud energy storage (CES) has recently been proposed as one of the most economic saving techniques for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing and coordination in energy internet. By transforming traditional consumers into self-sufficient customers and utility customers, CES enables transactions between customers and utility company, as well as among customers. In this paper, an architecture and operational technology which support P2P energy transactions are suggested based on the case of CES. With the aim of shared and virtually integrated CES among individual customers, a distributed algorithm is proposed to achieve higher renewable energy penetration and economic saving, in combination with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). On the basis of a real-world dataset of renewable energy and real-time electricity price, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of economic saving for a long time application.},

This, in turn, allows for a reduction in average energy consumption, which makes the computing facility more efficient from an environmental perspective.

	abstract = {There is abundant scientific evidence that the natural environment, on which we are completely dependent for life, is degrading and depleting to the extent that our medium- to long-term well-being and existence is under threat. It is also clear that IT is contributing to this degradation and depletion, which requires that Green IT practices be an imperative. Since Green IT practices are often not common sense, it is vital that these Green IT practices are taught to others, and teachers typically have the skills and opportunities to teach many people. This demonstrates the relevance and significance of the study. The research problem is the lack of research addressing the theoretical antecedents to teaching Green IT, which are considered vital for understanding how to improve student teachers' intention to teach Green IT and their resultant teaching of Green IT. The study addressed this research problem by surveying student teachers using a quantitative questionnaire at three teacher training institutions in Swaziland, Africa. The resultant data was analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) based on an a priori set of antecedents and their hypothesized relationships from the literature. The findings indicate that the most beneficial allocation of time and resources would be to enhance the student teachers' level of awareness, perceived behavioural control and person-related beliefs to positively influence their intention to teach Green IT, and consequently, their actual behaviour of teaching Green IT.},

	abstract = {Energy is a critical resource, and designing a sustainable software architecture is a non-trivial task. Developers require energy metrics that support sustainable software architectures reflecting quality attributes such as security, reliability, performance, etc., identifying what are the concerns that impact more in the energy consumption. A variability model of different designs and implementations of an energy model should exist for this task, as well as a service that stores and compares the experimentation results of energy and time consumption of each concern, finding out what is the most eco-efficient solution. The experimental measurements are performed by energy experts and researchers that share the energy model and metrics in a collaborative repository. HADAS confronts these tasks modelling and reasoning with the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts, connecting HADAS variability model with its energy efficiency collaborative repository, establishing a Software Product Line (SPL) service. Our main goal is to help developers to perform sustainability analyses finding out the eco-friendliest architecture configurations.

	abstract = {In the quest for energy efficiency of Information and Communication Technology, so far research has mostly focused on the role of hardware. However, as hardware technology becomes more sophisticated, the role of software becomes crucial. Recently, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, measuring the energy consumption of software has proven to be a challenge, due to the large number of variables that need to be controlled to obtain reliable measurements. Due to cost and time constraints, many software product organizations are unable to effectively measure the energy consumption of software. This prevents them to be in control over the energy efficiency of their products.In this paper, we propose a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a software product across different releases, from the perspective of a software organization. Our method allows to attribute differences in energy consumption to changes in the software. We validate our profiling method through an empirical experiment on two consecutive releases of a commercial software product. We demonstrate how the method can be applied by organizations and provide an analysis of the software related changes in energy consumption. Our results show that, despite a lack of precise measurements, energy consumption differences between releases of a software product can be quantified down to the level of individual processes. Additionally, the results provide insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption.},

In particular, in the field of industrial applications, where embedded devices cooperate with many IT systems to make the industrial processes more efficient, to reduce waste or raw materials, and to save the environment, the concept of green software becomes unclear. In this paper, we address the green aspects of software in different phases -- software construction, software execution, and software control in both inside an individual component and as a part of a complete industrial application. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insight into system knowledge, not aspects related to software per se, is the key to create truly green software. Consequently, when considering truly software green, the focus is to be placed on the system level savings for embedded systems at the highest possible level where domain knowledge can be taken into account, not on software development or execution.},

	abstract = {Green computing is a new paradigm of designing the computer system which considers not only the processing performance but also the energy efficiency. Power management is one of the approaches in green computing to reduce the power consumption in distributed computing system. In this paper, we first propose an optimal power management (OPM) used by a batch scheduler in a server farm. This OPM observes the state of a server farm and makes the decision to switch the operation mode (i.e., active or sleep) of the server to minimize the power consumption while the performance requirements are met. An optimization problem based on constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) is formulated and solved to obtain an optimal decision of OPM. Given that OPM is used in the server farm, then an assignment of users to the server farms by a job broker is considered. This assignment is to ensure that the cost due to power consumption and network transportation is minimized. The performance of the system is extensively evaluated. The result shows that with OPM the job waiting time can be maintained below the maximum threshold while the power consumption is much smaller than that without OPM.},

	abstract = {The "power wall" has forced chip and system architects to design with smaller margins between nominal and worst-case operating points. Localized hot spots and temperature gradients exacerbate lifetime reliability problems. Smaller voltage margins make processors more vulnerable to inductive noise on the voltage rails, as well as soft errors induced by high energy particle incidence. The problem of process variation presents another obstacle to sustained performance growth in the late CMOS design era. At the same time, the emerging phase change memory (a promising technology for future low power, dense storage in systems) is vulnerable to malicious attacks that can reduce the lifetime of an already wear-out prone technology. These issues have all led to R&amp;D in "better than worst-case" design principles. Dynamic power and thermal management control loops have already become an integral part of chip and system design. New research in wearout and general reliability management have recently been published. These new generation management protocols have, however, opened up other sources of concern: e.g. potential security holes exposed by the integrated control loops and system safety issues triggered by potential violations of power or thermal limits imposed by the original specification. We coin the term "Energy-Secure System Architectures" to cover the range of research being pursued within industry and academia in order to ensure robust and secure functionality, while meeting the energy-related constraints of the emerging "green computing" era.

	abstract = {The sustainability concerns of Information Technology (IT) go well beyond energy-efficient computing and require techniques for minimizing environmental impact of IT infrastructure over its entire life-cycle. Traditionally, IT infrastructure is overdesigned at all levels from chips to entire data centers and ecosystem; the paradigm explored in this article is to replace overdesign with rightsizing coupled with smarter control, henceforth referred to as Energy-Adaptive Computing or EAC. The article lays out the challenges of EAC in various environments in terms of the adaptation of the workload and the infrastructure to cope with energy and cooling deficiencies. The article then focuses on implementing EAC in a data center environment, and addresses the problem of simultaneous energy demand and energy supply regulation at multiple levels, work, from servers to the entire data center. The proposed control scheme adapts the assignments of tasks to servers in a way that can cope with the varying energy limitations. The article also presents some experimental results to show how the scheme can continue to meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of tasks under energy limitations.},

	abstract = {Mobile cloud computing is a computing paradigm that helps to reduce the application energy consumption, so increases the battery life. Mobile application is divided to fine grained tasks with sequential and parallel topology. Offloading application tasks to cloud provides more energy but increases the completion time. The scheduling of tasks between executing in mobile device and cloud is more important to limit the increasing in the completion time. In this paper, energy efficient ant colony cloud offloading algorithm (EACO) is developed to reduce the energy consumption with the hard condition of completion time. EACO decreases the energy by an average 24%-59% with increasing in completion time by 3.6%-28% compared with previous work. The algorithm is verified in different experiments with different tasks input data and computation workload.},

	abstract = {As energy costs become increasingly greater contributors to a cloud provider's overall costs, it is important for the cloud to recoup these energy costs from its tenants for profitability via appropriate pricing design. The poor predictability of real-world tenants' demand and demand responses (DRs) make such pricing design a challenging problem. We formulate a leader-follower game-based cloud pricing framework with the goal of maximizing cloud's profit. The key distinguishing aspect of our approach is our emphasis on modeling both the cloud and its tenants as working with low predictability in their inputs. Consequently, we model them as employing myopic control with short-term predictive models. Our empirical evaluation using tenant trace from IBM production data centers shows that (i) cloud's profit and VM prices are sensitive to the tradeoffs between its energy costs, tenant's demand and DR, and (ii) the cloud's estimation of tenants' demands/DR may significantly affect its profitability.},

Findings suggest that Indian students are adequately aware of the terms related to Green IT and the specific reasons for its adoption. Moreover, results suggest that Indian students follow Green IT practices; largely dominated by those practices which promote "reducing paper consumption". However, there exist a significant percentage of Indian students who are willing to adopt Green IT, but the relatively higher cost of adoption seems to be an inhibitor.},

	abstract = {The cloud-computing paradigm offers on-demand services over the Internet and supports a wide variety of applications. With the recent growth of Internet of Things (IoT)--based applications, the use of cloud services is increasing exponentially. The next generation of cloud computing must be energy efficient and sustainable to fulfill end-user requirements, which are changing dynamically. Presently, cloud providers are facing challenges to ensure the energy efficiency and sustainability of their services. The use of a large number of cloud datacenters increases cost as well as carbon footprints, which further affects the sustainability of cloud services. In this article, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable cloud computing. The taxonomy is used to investigate the existing techniques for sustainability that need careful attention and investigation as proposed by several academic and industry groups. The current research on sustainable cloud computing is organized into several categories: application design, sustainability metrics, capacity planning, energy management, virtualization, thermal-aware scheduling, cooling management, renewable energy, and waste heat utilization. The existing techniques have been compared and categorized based on common characteristics and properties. A conceptual model for sustainable cloud computing has been presented along with a discussion on future research directions.},

	abstract = {In cloud data centers, different mapping relationships between virtual machines (VMs) and physical machines (PMs) cause different resource utilization, therefore, how to place VMs on PMs to improve resource utilization and reduce energy consumption is one of the major concerns for cloud providers. The existing VM placement schemes are to optimize physical server resources utilization or network resources utilization, but few of them focuses on optimizing multiple resources utilization simultaneously. To address the issue, this paper proposes a VM placement scheme meeting multiple resource constraints, such as the physical server size (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth, etc.) and network link capacity to improve resource utilization and reduce both the number of active physical servers and network elements so as to finally reduce energy consumption. Since VM placement problem is abstracted as a combination of bin packing problem and quadratic assignment problem, which is also known as a classic combinatorial optimization and NP-hard problem, we design a novel greedy algorithm by combining minimum cut with the best-fit, and the simulations show that our solution achieves better results.},

The growing importance for parallel applications in the cloud introduces significant challenges in reducing the power consumption drawn by the hosted servers. In this paper, we propose an enhanced energy-efficient scheduling (EES) algorithm to reduce energy consumption while meeting the performance-based service level agreement (SLA). Since slacking non-critical jobs can achieve significant power saving, we exploit the slack room and allocate them in a global manner in our schedule. Using random generated and real-life application workflows, our results demonstrate that EES is able to reduce considerable energy consumption while still meeting SLA.},

The management of Cloud Data Centers (CDC) requires an accurate planning and an efficient use of system resources in order to save energy consumption ("greening"), to provide Quality of Service (QoS), and to meet negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLA). This contribution addresses the question of modeling and the development of generic queuing models for energy-efficient use of resources for dynamic load balancing in virtualized CDCs. Performance models are developed for energy efficiency through automatic Server Consolidation, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) under Static Load Balancing; Dynamic Load Balancing can be achieved through Virtual Machine (VM) migrations. The analysis of such models provides quantitative performance figures upon which the system operation can be optimized with respect to guaranteed real-time performance and energy efficiency under prescribed SLAs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two exact algorithms for energy efficient scheduling of virtual machines (VMs) in cloud data centers. Modeling of energy aware allocation and consolidation to minimize overall energy consumption leads us to the combination of an optimal allocation algorithm with a consolidation algorithm relying on migration of VMs at service departures. The optimal allocation algorithm is solved as a bin packing problem with a minimum power consumption objective. It is compared with an energy aware best fit algorithm. The exact migration algorithm results from a linear and integer formulation of VM migration to adapt placement when resources are released. The proposed migration is general and goes beyond the current state of the art by minimizing both the number of migrations needed for consolidation and energy consumption in a single algorithm with a set of valid inequalities and conditions. Experimental results show the benefits of combining the allocation and migration algorithms and demonstrate their ability to achieve significant energy savings while maintaining feasible convergence times when compared with the best fit heuristic.},

	abstract = {As a direct consequence of the increasing popularity of Cloud Computing solutions, data centers are amazingly growing and hence have to urgently face with the energy consumption issue. Available solutions rely on Cloud Computing models and virtualization techniques to scale up/down application based on their performance metrics. Although those proposals can reduce the energy footprint of applications and by transitivity of cloud infrastructures, they do not consider the internal characteristics of applications to finely define a trade-off between applications Quality of Service and energy footprint. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach that considers both application internals and system to reduce the energy footprint in cloud infrastructure. Each application and the infrastructure are equipped with their own control loop, which allows them to autonomously optimize their executions. Simulations show that the approach may lead to appreciable energy savings without interfering on application provider revenues.},

Consequently, cloud service providers, should not only attempt to provide competitive services to their customers, but also keep at the same time their operational costs at acceptable levels by minimizing energy consumption. The reduction of the number of active servers, using live virtual machine (VM) migrations, while keeping the system performance within the levels specified by the SLAs with customers, are main objectives of cloud service providers towards the above goals. In this paper, an efficient VM provisioning mechanism for cloud data center environments is proposed.

	abstract = {We are at the threshold of an explosion in new data, produced not only by large, powerful scientific and commercial computers, but also by billions of low-power devices. The traditional techniques of processing such information by first storing them in databases and then manipulating and serving them through large computers are becoming too expensive. These complex large systems have a high acquisition cost, but in addition, suffer also from high running costs, especially in power consumption. Both these costs can be contained by recognizing that there is a precision implied by traditional computing that is not needed in the processing of most new types of data. The relaxation of precision can help in the wider exploitation of known energy-efficient modes of computing like throughput computing. More important, such relaxation provides us an opportunity to deploy in the processing of this vast new data the same low-power, low-cost technology that was used to generate the data in the first place. Such energy-efficient circuits suffer from greater unreliability and variability in performance when used in the high-throughput mode, but these problems can be addressed by changing the way we design such systems, changing the nature of the algorithms for such systems, and by modifying the expectation of the quality of results produced by such systems. We have called this the approximate computing paradigm.There are two sources of imperfection in approximate computing. The first arises from imperfect execution of an algorithm. The second arises from imperfection in the data stream itself. All these imperfections could potentially be rectified through the use of expensive techniques such as redundancy, conservative design, or conservative device operating range. The goal of approximate computing, however, is to combat these sources of imperfection inexpensively and in an energy-efficient manner while producing results that may be different, yet acceptable. Computing models that achieve this goal have to address both the detection and the correction of such imperfections. The detection of such imperfections can be done either by the user observing and reacting to a wrong result, by the algorithm expecting a range of correct results, or by the run-time monitoring of the execution of the system. The correction of system behavior can be done either by attempting a different algorithm, by patching the code, or by repeating the execution. We will argue in this talk that future systems will need to combine all these techniques and integrate new ones into a single dynamically optimized system that employs feedback from the user to guide the high-level choice of energy-efficient algorithms, and that employs prediction based on past experience to guide the low-level energy-efficient execution of the system. This has a tantalizing similarity to some models of functioning of a remarkably efficient approximate computing appliance we all know -- the human brain.},

The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer who asks, "will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?" One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of static OO software metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azureus/Vuze BitTorrent client. We found evidence of a potential relationship between some software metrics and power consumption. In conclusion, we explored the effect of software change on power consumption on two projects; and we provide an initial investigation on the impact of software metrics on power consumption.},

Unfortunately there is a severe lack of publicly available software power use performance data. This means that green mining researchers must generate this data themselves by writing tests, building multiple revisions of a product, and then running these tests multiple times (10+) for each software revision while measuring power use. Then, they must aggregate these measurements to estimate the energy consumed by the tests for each software revision. This is time consuming and is made more difficult by the constraints of mobile devices and their OSes. In this paper we propose, implement, and demonstrate Green Miner: the first dedicated hardware mining software repositories testbed. The Green Miner physically measures the energy consumption of mobile devices (Android phones) and automates the testing of applications, and the reporting of measurements back to developers and researchers.

This migration can ensure significant energy savings as utilization of local resources contribute to 40% of the Greenhouse Gas emissions of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). On the other hand, provisioning of the cloud services needs to be handled carefully since energy consumption of the transport network, as well as the energy consumed by the data centers, is expected to increase. We revisit our previously proposed Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models that are used to reconfigure the cloud network design with look-ahead demand profile. Due to long runtimes of the MILP models in large-scale scenarios, in this paper, we propose two heuristics to reconfigure the cloud network for provisioning the cloud and Internet computing demands. The first heuristic aims to minimize the propagation delay while the second one targets minimizing the power consumption of the data centers and the transport network. We verify the heuristics through simulations where MILP models are used as the benchmarks. Numerical results show that power minimized provisioning can guarantee significant energy savings in the cloud network with less resource consumption. We also present the energy versus delay trade-off and point out possible solutions.},

	abstract = {A growing number of software solutions have been proposed to address application-level energy consumption problems in the last few years. However, little is known about how much software developers are concerned about energy consumption, what aspects of energy consumption they consider important, and what solutions they have in mind for improving energy efficiency. In this paper we present the first empirical study on understanding the views of application programmers on software energy consumption problems. Using StackOverflow as our primary data source, we analyze a carefully curated sample of more than 300 questions and 550 answers from more than 800 users. With this data, we observed a number of interesting findings. Our study shows that practitioners are aware of the energy consumption problems: the questions they ask are not only diverse -- we found 5 main themes of questions -- but also often more interesting and challenging when compared to the control question set. Even though energy consumption-related questions are popular when considering a number of different popularity measures, the same cannot be said about the quality of their answers. In addition, we observed that some of these answers are often flawed or vague. We contrast the advice provided by these answers with the state-of-the-art research on energy consumption. Our summary of software energy consumption problems may help researchers focus on what matters the most to software developers and end users.},

	abstract = {GreenIT has emerged as a discipline concerned with the optimization of software solutions with regards to their energy consumption. In this domain, most of the state-of-the-art solutions concentrate on coarse-grained approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. However, none of the existing solutions addresses in-process energy monitoring to provide in-depth analysis of a process energy consumption. In this paper, we therefore report on a fine-grained runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to help developers to diagnose energy hotspots with a better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. Concretely, our approach adopts a 2-layer architecture including OS-level and process-level energy monitoring. OS-level energy monitoring estimates the energy consumption of processes according to different hardware devices (CPU, network card). Process-level energy monitoring focuses on Java-based applications and builds on OS-level energy monitoring to provide an estimation of energy consumption at the granularity of classes and methods. We argue that this per-method analysis of energy consumption provides better insights to the application in order to identify potential energy hotspots. In particular, our preliminary validation demonstrates that we can monitor energy hotspots of Jetty web servers and monitor their variations under stress scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient and accurate high-level software energy estimation methodology using the concept of characterization-based macro-modeling. In characterization-based macro-modeling, a function or sub-routine is characterized using an accurate lower-level energy model of the target processor, to construct a macro-model that relates the energy consumed in the function under consideration to various parameters that can be easily observed or calculated from a high-level programming language description. The constructed macro-models eliminate the need for significantly slower instruction-level interpretation or hardware simulation that is required in conventional approaches to software energy estimation.We present two different approaches to macro-modeling for embedded software that offer distinct efficiency-accuracy characteristics: (i) complexity-based macro-modeling, where the variables that determine the algorithmic complexity of the function under consideration are used as macro-modeling parameters, and (ii) profiling-based macro-modeling, where internal profiling statistics for the functions are used as parameters in the energy macro-models. We have experimentally validated our software energy macro-modeling techniques on a wide range of embedded software routines and two different target processor architectures. Our experiments demonstrate that high-level macro-models constructed using the proposed techniques are able to estimate the energy consumption to within 95% accuracy on the average, while commanding speedups of one to five orders-of-magnitude over current instruction-level and architectural energy estimation techniques.},

It divides a physical machine into many half or full isolated machines (known as Virtual Machines-VMs) using various allocation techniques. To identify a technique that can satisfy a quality of service in consideration of energy consumption in Cloud environment is one of the challenging issues for Virtual Machine allocation in Cloud as there are tradeoffs between energy consumption and performance. In the present research, we aim to survey various techniques that combine energy efficiency and performance.

	abstract = {As the demand for cloud computing services continues to grow, the requirement for expanding cloud data centers also increases. One main issue facing this growth is the huge amount of energy consumed by the cloud data centers. The massive energy consumption expenses considered the main problem for cloud service providers. Recent reports revealed that the electricity expenses of Information and communications technology or (ICT) devices occupy 42% per month of the total budgets. Nevertheless, the continuous increase in energy consumption has become the main challenging subject. Due to this reason, researches have proposed many techniques and approaches (such as virtual machine VM consolidation, Voltage and Frequency Scaling, VM migration policies, etc.) for addressing this issue. This paper presents a study to evaluate the influence of controlling virtual machine central process unit (vCPU) on energy consumption of Cloud data center. CloudSim simulator is used to apply the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique with the proposed approach while processing different types of general purpose cloud computing applications (video streaming, file compression process, and video games). Results indicate that about 13% of data center energy was saved compared with the base DVFS system. This saving percentage result was a better percentage comparing with other results obtained from previous work.},

This paper designs a nonlinear energy consumption model based on polynomials and exponents to measure the energy consumption of different deployment schemes. It is the basis of the deployment strategy. At the heart of this paper, the probability transfer function and the fitness function are designed to optimize the ant colony algorithm. Finally a multi-objective optimization ant colony algorithm based on threshold-dependent pheromone updating was proposed. The algorithm is a kind of distributed optimization method, which is beneficial to parallel computation and has a positive feedback mechanism. The optimal solution can be efficiently obtained by continuous updating of pheromone. The experimental results show that the ant colony algorithm of multi-objective virtual machine placement can achieve the optimal trade-off between multiple conflicting targets, so that the system's energy consumption is less, the violation rate of user service level and the resource utilization rate is also small.},

In this paper, we analyze the opportunities and challenges associated with this topic while executing a set of 275 parametric energy models simultaneously in EnergyPlus using a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. Successful parallel computing implementation of building energy simulations will not only improve the time necessary to get the results and enable scenario development for different design considerations, but also might enable Dynamic-Building Information Modeling (BIM) integration and near real-time decision-making.

	abstract = {In order to curtail the continuous increase in power consumption of modern datacenters, researchers are responding with sophisticated energy-aware workload management methods. This increases the complexity and cost of the management operation, and may lead to increases in failure rates. The goal of this paper is to illustrate that there exists considerable diversity in the effectiveness of different, potentially 'smarter' workload management methods depending on the target metric or the characteristics of the workload being managed. We conduct experiments on a datacenter prototype platform, virtualized with the VMware vSphere software, and using representative cloud applications -- a distributed key-value store and a map-reduce computation. We observe that, on our testbed, different workload placement decisions may be quite effective for some metrics, but may lead to only marginal impact on others. In particular, we are considering the impact on energy-related metrics, such as power or temperature, as corresponding energy-aware management methods typically come with greater complexity due to fact that they must consider the complex energy consumption trends of various components in the cloud infrastructure. We show that for certain applications, such costs can be avoided, as different management policies and placement decisions have marginal impact on the target metric. The objective is to understand whether for certain classes of applications, and/or application configurations, it is necessary to incur, or if it is benefitial to avoid, the use of complex management methods.},

These properties are often hardware-specific, time-intensive to optimize, and may not be amenable to standard dataflow optimizations. We present a general post-compilation approach called Genetic Optimization Algorithm (GOA), which targets measurable non-functional aspects of software execution in programs that compile to x86 assembly. GOA combines insights from profile-guided optimization, superoptimization, evolutionary computation and mutational robustness. GOA searches for program variants that retain required functional behavior while improving non-functional behavior, using characteristic workloads and predictive modeling to guide the search. The resulting optimizations are validated using physical performance measurements and a larger held-out test suite. Our experimental results on PARSEC benchmark programs show average energy reductions of 20%, both for a large AMD system and a small Intel system, while maintaining program functionality on target workloads.},

Due to its wide adaptability and ease of use, Cloud has emerged drastically over the last few years. However, increase in Cloud usage has lead to increase in number of computing resources and hence, increase in energy consumption. Recently, the issue of effective energy consumption has been addressed by a good number of researchers. In our work, we intend to study various energy efficient techniques for Cloud which uses resource allocation and consolidation to achieve the same. Further, we try to modify the existing technique by adding an extra parameter viz. time which assists in maximizing resource utilization and minimizing number of running servers.},

	abstract = {Motivation: In modern it systems, the increasing demand for computational power is tightly coupled with ever higher energy consumption. Traditionally, energy efficiency research has focused on reducing energy consumption at the hardware level. Nevertheless, the software itself provides numerous opportunities for improving energy efficiency.Goal: Given that energy efficiency for it systems is a rising concern, we investigate existing work in the area of energy-aware software development and identify open research challenges. Our goal is to reveal limitations, features, and tradeoffs regarding energy-performance for software development and provide insights on existing approaches, tools, and techniques for energy-efficient programming.Method: We analyze and categorize research work mostly extracted from top-tier conferences and journals concerning energy efficiency across the software development lifecycle phases.Results: Our analysis shows that related work in this area has focused mainly on the implementation and verification phases of the software development lifecycle. Existing work shows that the use of parallel and approximate programming, source code analyzers, efficient data structures, coding practices, and specific programming languages can significantly increase energy efficiency. Moreover, the utilization of energy monitoring tools and benchmarks can provide insights for the software practitioners and raise energy-awareness during the development phase.},

	abstract = {In virtualized data centers, consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) on minimizing the number of total physical machines (PMs) has been recognized as a very efficient approach. This paper considers the energy-efficient consolidation of VMs in a Cloud Data center. Concentrating on CPU-intensive applications, the objective is to schedule all requests non-preemptively, subjecting to constraints of PM capacities and running time interval spans, such that the total energy consumption of all PMs is minimized (called MinTE for abbreviation). The MinTE problem is NP-complete in general. We propose a self-adaptive approached called SAVE. The approach makes decisions of the assignment and migration of VMs by probabilistic processes and is based exclusively on local information, therefore it is very simple to implement. Both simulation and real environment test show that our proposed method SAVE can reduce energy consumption about 30% against VMWare DRS and 10-20% against EcoCloud on average.},

We consider several users with energy constrained tasks that can be offloaded over cloudlets or on a remote cloud with differentiated system and network resources capacities. We investigate offloading policy that decides which tasks should be offloaded and determine the offloading location on the cloudlets or on the cloud. The objective is to minimize the total energy consumed by the users. We formulate this problem as a Non-Linear Binary Integer Programming. Since the centralized optimal solution is NP-hard, we propose a distributed linear relaxation heuristic based on Lagrangian decomposition approach. To solve the subproblems, we also propose a greedy heuristic that computes the best cloudlet selection and bandwidth allocation following tasks' energy consumption. We compared our proposal against existing approaches under different system parameters (e.g. CPU resources), variable number of users and for six applications, each having specific traffic pattern, resource demands and time constraints. Numerical results show that our proposal outperforms existing approaches. We also analyze the performance of our proposal for each application.},

The commensurate increase in the cost of building infrastructure capable of powering such massive data centers and the recurring energy costs to keep such data centers operational has exposed power as a first-order design constraint. Such data centers are typically overprovisioned to avoid unexpected outages associated with the potential overloading of electrical circuitry [8], [9]. However, these data centers are under-utilized due to the inherent nature of the workloads [5], [8] and the need to provide isolation to mitigate serious violation of performance agreements (i.e., throughput and response time constraints) [9].

The eco-friendly daemon is an interval-based, run-time algorithm that uses the workload characterization to dynamically adjust a processor's frequency and voltage to reduce power and energy consumption with little impact on application performance. Using the NAS Parallel Benchmarks as our workload, we then evaluate our eco-friendly daemon on a cluster computer. The results indicate that our workload characterization allows the power-aware daemon to more tightly control performance (5% loss instead of 11%) while delivering substantial energy savings (11% instead of 8%).},

	abstract = {Data centres are powerful ICT facilities which constantly evolve in size, complexity, and power consumption. At the same time users' and operators' requirements become more and more complex. However, existing data centre frameworks do not typically take energy consumption into account as a key parameter of the data centre's configuration. To lower the power consumption while fulfilling performance requirements we propose a flexible and energy-aware framework for the (re)allocation of virtual machines in a data centre. The framework, being independent from the data centre management system, computes and enacts the best possible placement of virtual machines based on constraints expressed through service level agreements. The framework's flexibility is achieved by decoupling the expressed constraints from the algorithms using the Constraint Programming (CP) paradigm and programming language, basing ourselves on a cluster management library called Entropy. Finally, the experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving the pursued energy optimization goals.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of a plethora of embedded and portable applications, energy dissipation has joined throughput, area, and accuracy/precision as a major design constraint. Thus, designers must be concerned with both optimizing and estimating the energy consumption of circuits, architectures, and software. Most of the research in energy optimization and/or estimation has focused on single components of the system and has not looked across the interacting spectrum of the hardware and software. The novelty of our new energy estimation framework, SimplePower, is that it evaluates the energy considering the system as a whole rather than just as a sum of parts, and that it concurrently supports both compiler and architectural experimentation.We present the design and use of the SimplePower framework that includes a transition-sensitive, cycle-accurate datapath energy model that interfaces with analytical and transition sensitive energy models for the memory and bus subsystems, respectively. We analyzed the energy consumption of ten codes from the multidimensional array domain, a domain that is important for embedded video and signal processing systems, after applying different compiler and architectural optimizations. Our experiments demonstrate that early estimates from the SimplePower energy estimation framework can help identify the system energy hotspots and enable architects and compiler designers to focus their efforts on these areas.},

	abstract = {With the SIMT execution model, GPUs can hidememory latency through massive multithreading for many applications that have regular memory access patterns. To support applications with irregular memory access patterns, cache hierarchies have been introduced to GPU architectures to capture temporal and spatial locality and mitigate the effect of irregular accesses. However, GPU caches exhibit poor efficiency due to the mismatch of the throughput-oriented execution model and its cache hierarchy design, which limits system performance and energy-efficiency.The massive amount of memory requests generated by GPU scause cache contention and resource congestion. Existing CPUcache management policies that are designed for multicore systems, can be suboptimal when directly applied to GPUcaches. We propose a specialized cache management policy for GPGPUs. The cache hierarchy is protected from contention by the bypass policy based on reuse distance. Contention and resource congestion are detected at runtime. To avoid oversaturatingon-chip resources, the bypass policy is coordinated with warp throttling to dynamically control the active number of warps. We also propose a simple predictor to dynamically estimate the optimal number of active warps that can take full advantage of the cache space and on-chip resources. Experimental results show that cache efficiency is significantly improved and on-chip resources are better utilized for cache sensitive benchmarks. This results in a harmonic mean IPCimprovement of 74% and 17% (maximum 661% and 44% IPCimprovement), compared to the baseline GPU architecture and optimal static warp throttling, respectively.},

However, while industry is convinced of the energy impact of hardware, the role of software has mostly been acknowledged by researchers in software engineering. Strengthened by the limited practical knowledge to reduce the energy consumption, organizations have less control over the energy impact of their products and lose the contribution of software towards energy related strategies. Consequently, industry risks not being able to meet customer requirements or even fulfill corporate sustainability goals.In this paper we perform an exploratory case study on how to create and maintain awareness on an energy consumption perspective for software among stakeholders involved with the development of software products. During the study, we followed the development process of two commercial software products and provided direct feedback to the stakeholders on the effects of their development efforts, specifically concerning energy consumption and performance, using an energy dashboard. Multiple awareness measurements allowed us to keep track of changes over time on specific aspects affecting software development. Our results show that, despite a mixed sentiment towards the dashboard, changed awareness has triggered discussion on the energy consumption of software.},

Models of soft- and hardware components at runtime, expressing current and alternative system configurations, are exploited to improve service utility as well as to decrease energy consumption. In recent work we showed how quality contracts---expressing dependencies between software and hardware components---can be used for energy auto-tuning. Notably, the declared provisions and requirements of individual components depend on software containers (i.e., the servers, components are deployed on) and thus, cannot be declared completely at design time. In this paper we present a semi-automated contract creation process that combines manual created contract templates with benchmarking and mathematical approximations for non-functional properties depending on the components' runtime behavior as well as their service's input parameters. We identify individual process activities and show how the process can be applied to approximate the non-functional behavior of software components providing simple sorting functionality.},

We observe that reducing the refresh rate of volatile STT-RAM will provide significant energy savings while introducing a small number of bit errors that can be easily tolerated by most error-resilient applications. Thus, we propose a quality-aware approximate die-stacking hybrid cache and develop a novel data allocation scheme.

	abstract = {Cloud computing has attracted significant attention due to the increasing demand for low-cost, high performance, and energy-efficient computing. Profit maximization for the cloud service provider (CSP) is a key objective in the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-user environment of a cloud system. This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the operation cost of a cloud system by maximizing its energy efficiency while ensuring that user deadlines as defined in Service Level Agreements are met. The workload in the cloud system can be modeled as independent batch requests or as task graphs with dependencies. This paper adopts the latter modeling approach, which provides more opportunities for energy and performance optimizations, thus enabling the CSP to meet user deadlines at lower operation costs. However, these optimizations require additional supporting efforts e.g., resource provisioning, virtual machine placement, and task scheduling, which are addressed in a holistic manner in the proposed framework. In the envisioned cloud environment, users can construct their own services and applications based on the available set of virtual machines, but are relieved from the burden of resource provisioning and task scheduling. The CSP will then exploit data parallelism in user workloads to create an energy and deadline-aware cloud platform.},

We found that standard techniques for system identification do not produce acceptable models of energy consumption and performance, due to the intricate interplay between the discrete nature of software and the continuous nature of energy and performance. This motivated us to perform a detailed empirical study of the energy consumption and performance of this system with varying compression algorithms and compression levels, file types, persistent storage media, CPU DVFS levels, and disk I/O schedulers. Our results identify and illustrate factors that complicate the system's energy consumption and performance, including nonlinearity, instability, and multi-dimensionality.

The focus of the study is on energy savings possible through this approach in the context of large and challenging applications. We choose two such from different ends of the computing spectrum---the IGCM model for weather and climate modeling which embodies significant features of a high-performance computing workload, and the ubiquitous PageRank algorithm used in Internet search. In both cases, we are able to show in the affirmative that an inexact system outperforms its exact counterpart in terms of its efficiency quantified through the relative metric of operations per virtual Joule (OPVJ)---a relative metric that is not tied to particular hardware technology. As one example, the IGCM application can be used to achieve savings through inexactness of (almost) a factor of 3 in energy without compromising the quality of the forecast, quantified through the forecast error metric, in a noticeable manner. As another example finding, we show that in the case of PageRank, an inexact system is able to outperform its exact counterpart by close to a factor of 1.5 using the OPVJ metric.},

Adding to the problem is the inability of the servers to exhibit energy proportionality, i.e., provide energy-efficient execution under all levels of utilization, which diminishes the overall energy efficiency of the data center. It is imperative that we realize effective strategies to control the power consumption of the server and improve the energy efficiency of data centers. With the advent of Intel Sandy Bridge processors, we have the ability to specify a limit on power consumption during runtime, which creates opportunities to design new power-management techniques for enterprise workloads and make the systems that they run on more energy proportional.In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to achieve energy proportionality for an enterprise-class server workload, namely SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark, by using Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interfaces. First, we analyze the power consumption and characterize the instantaneous power profile of the SPECpower benchmark within different subsystems using the on-chip energy meters exposed via the RAPL interfaces. We then analyze the impact of RAPL power limiting on the performance, per-transaction response time, power consumption, and energy efficiency of the benchmark under different load levels. Our observations and results shed light on the efficacy of the RAPL interfaces and provide guidance for designing power-management techniques for enterprise-class workloads.},

Recent empirical studies indicate that software engineers can support the goal of reducing energy usage by making design and implementation decisions in ways that take into consideration how such decisions impact the energy usage of an application. However, the large number of possible choices and the lack of feedback and information available to software engineers necessitates some form of automated decision-making support. This paper describes the first known automated support for systematically optimizing the energy usage of applications by making code-level changes. It is effective at reducing energy usage while freeing developers from needing to deal with the low-level, tedious tasks of applying changes and monitoring the resulting impacts to the energy usage of their application. We present a general framework, SEEDS, as well as an instantiation of the framework that automatically optimizes Java applications by selecting the most energy-efficient library implementations for Java's Collections API. Our empirical evaluation of the framework and instantiation show that it is possible to improve the energy usage of an application in a fully automated manner for a reasonable cost.},

	abstract = {Approximate computing (AC) techniques provide overall performance gains in terms of power and energy savings at the cost of minor loss in application accuracy. For this reason, AC has emerged as a viable method for efficiently supporting several compute-intensive applications, e.g., machine learning, deep learning, and image processing, that can tolerate bounded errors in computations. However, most prior techniques do not consider the possibility of soft errors or malicious bit-flips in AC systems. These errors may interact with approximation-introduced errors in unforeseen ways, leading to disastrous consequences, such as the failure of computing systems. A recent research effort, FTApprox (DATE'21) proposes an error-resilient approximate data format. FTApprox stores two blocks, starting from the one containing the most significant valid (MSV) bit. It also stores location of the MSV block and protects them using error-correcting bits (ECBs). However, FTApprox has crucial limitations such as lack of flexibility, redundantly storing zeros in the MSV, etc.In this paper, we propose a novel storage format named Versatile Approximate Data Format (VADF) for storing approximate integer numbers while providing resilience to soft errors. VADF prescribes rules for storing, for example, a 32-bit number in either 8-bit, 12-bit or 16-bit numbers. VADF identifies the MSV bit and stores a certain number of bits following the MSV bit. It also stores the location of the MSV bit and protects it by ECBs. VADF does not explicitly store the MSB bit itself and this prevents VADF from accruing significant errors. VADF incurs lower error than both truncation methodologies and FTApprox. We further evaluate five image-processing and machine-learning applications and confirm that VADF provides higher application quality than FTApprox in the presence and absence of soft errors. Finally, VADF allows the use of narrow arithmetic units. For example, instead of using a 32-bit multiplier/adder, one can first use VADF (or FTApprox) to compress the data and then use a 8-bit multiplier/adder. Through this approach, VADF facilitates 95.97% and 79.3% energy savings in multiplication and addition, respectively. However, the subsequent re-conversion of the 8-bit output data to 32-bit data using Inv-VADF(16,3,32) diminishes the energy savings by 9.6% for addition and 0.56% for multiplication operation, respectively.

However, developers still lack knowledge about how to produce, evaluate and evolve their software considering energy consumption, which might limit their execution in some platforms and prevent users from adopting them. Towards providing more support for energy consumption analysis, we provide a set of properties to analyse software consumption considering not only energy costs but also probabilistic information. We demonstrate how to use, combine and interpret the results of analyses of these properties. We discuss experiments involving the analysis of the proposed properties in different scenarios and how, based on the results of these analyses, recommendations of possible actions to adjust energy consumption can be proposed.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates managing the processor's datapath-width at the compiler level by means of exploiting dynamic narrow-width operands. We capitalize on the large occurrence of these operands in multimedia programs to build static narrow-width regions that may be directly exposed to the compiler. We propose to augment the ISA with instructions directly exposing the datapath and the register widths to the compiler. Simple exception management allows this exposition to be only speculative. In this way, we permit the software to speculatively accommodate the execution of a program on a narrower datapath-width in order to save energy. For this purpose, we introduce a novel register file organization, the byte-slice register file, which allows the width of the register file to be dynamically reconfigured, providing both static and dynamic energy savings. We show that by combining the advantages of the byte-slice register file with the advantages provided by clock-gating the datapath on a per-region basis, up to 17% of the datapath dynamic energy can be saved, while a 22% reduction of the register file static energy is achieved.},

	abstract = {Energy-efficiency has emerged as a major barrier to performance scalability for modern processors. We note that significant part of processor's energy requirement is contributed by processor-memory communication. To address the energy issue in processors, we propose a novel hardware accelerator framework that transforms high-density memory array into a configurable computing resource to accelerate variety of tasks - both compute- and data-intensive. It exploits the block-based architecture of nanoscale memory to create a spatially connected array of lightweight processors, each of which uses a memory block as its local memory. The proposed framework provides some unique advantages for hardware acceleration compared to conventional accelerators: 1) memory array provides large set of parallel resources with high bandwidth, which can be configured to perform computing in spatio/temporal manner leading to dramatic reduction in processor-memory traffic; 2) it brings the computing engine close to the data, thus drastically minimizing the von Neumann bottleneck; 3) finally, it exploits the advances in memory technologies and integration approaches e.g. 3D integration to achieve better technology scalability compared to alternative reconfigurable accelerator platforms. Simulation results for several data-intensive applications show that the proposed computing approach provides significant improvement in energy-efficiency compared to software while achieving significantly lower hardware overhead.},

	abstract = {Along the last decade, several studies considered green software design as a key development concern to improve the energy efficiency of software. Yet, few techniques address this concern for Software Product Lines (SPL). In this paper, we therefore introduce two approaches to measure and reduce the energy consumption of a SPL by analyzing a limited set of products sampled from this SPL. While the first approach relies on the analysis of individual feature consumptions, the second one takes feature interactions into account to better mitigate energy consumption of resulting products.Our experimental results on a real-world SPL indicate that both approaches succeed to produce significant energy improvements on a large number of products, while consumption data was modeled from a small set of sampled products. Furthermore, we show that taking feature interactions into account leads to more products improved with higher energy savings per product.},

To reduce the energy consumption of an application the developer needs: (i) to identify what are the concerns that will impact more in the energy consumption; (ii) to model the variability of alternative designs and implementations of each concern; (iii) to store and compare the experimentation results related with the energy and time consumption of concerns; (iv) to find out what is the most eco-efficient solution for each concern. HADAS addresses these issues by modelling the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts. It connects the variability model with a repository that stores energy measurements, providing a Software Product Line (SPL) service, helping developers to reason and find out what are the most eco-friendly configurations.

	abstract = {Energy consumption is by far the most important contributor to HPC cluster operational costs, and it accounts for a significant share of the total cost of ownership. Advanced energy-saving techniques in HPC components have received significant research and development effort, but a simple measure that can dramatically reduce energy consumption is often overlooked. We show that, in capacity computing, where many small to medium-sized jobs have to be solved at the lowest cost, a practical energy-saving approach is to scale-in the application on large-memory nodes. We evaluate scaling-in; i.e. decreasing the number of application processes and compute nodes (servers) to solve a fixed-sized problem, using a set of HPC applications running in a production system. Using standard-memory nodes, we obtain average energy savings of 36%, already a huge figure. We show that the main source of these energy savings is a decrease in the node-hours (node_hours = #nodes x exe_time), which is a consequence of the more efficient use of hardware resources.Scaling-in is limited by the per-node memory capacity. We therefore consider using large-memory nodes to enable a greater degree of scaling-in. We show that the additional energy savings, of up to 52%, mean that in many cases the investment in upgrading the hardware would be recovered in a typical system lifetime of less than five years.},

In addition, process variability issues lead to performance and power uncertainties, impacting expected quality of service and energy efficiency of the running software. In particular, variability may lead to sub-optimal runtime task allocation.In this paper we present a holistic approach to tackle these issues exploiting high level HW/SW modeling to customize the runtime library. The customization introduces variability awareness in task allocation decisions, with the final purpose of optimizing a given objective: Execution time, power consumption, or overall energy consumption.We present a complete walkthrough, from top-level modeling down to variability-aware execution using a parallelized computational kernel running on a next generation, NoC based, heterogeneous multicore simulation platform.},

This exponential growth of datacenters increases the energy consumption, along with its carbon footprints. Hence, better energy aware techniques not only reduce energy costs, but they are also helpful for reducing pollution in the environment. Some of the main challenges for cloud providers include increasing the resource utilization and minimizing energy consumption while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) offered to the users. There are many load balancing and resource allocation techniques proposed to handle these challenges. Out of these techniques, only a few consider QoS goals for IaaS service providers. However, none of these techniques includes service level agreement (SLA) parameters related to the Virtual Machine (VM) life cycle such as VM startup times.

	abstract = {The applications that run on resource-constrained devices, especially for batteries, pose a challenge. The activities such applications do while running on such devices consume energy and drain the device's battery. Many of these applications use REST API to communicate with their backend services running outside of the devices, primarily on the cloud. The paradigms like Model View View-Model (MVVM) used on the application side require data transformations that cause applications to consume more battery. There is a need for an improved approach and a paradigm that can be used to develop green software with reduced battery consumption. This paper proposes a novel Remote-Model View Remote-View-Model (RMVRVM) paradigm. The use of RMVRVM paradigm lowers the battery consumption on devices where the application is running and hence contributes to writing green software. In addition, RMVRVM makes an application more responsive and thus a delight to use. This paradigm has been implemented in industrial case studies, and significant gains in terms of the reduced amount of data transfer, reduced battery consumption, and faster response time were observed. Experiments were also done to further validate the paradigm with encouraging results. The practitioners can apply the RMVRVM to design applications for battery-constrained devices with smaller energy footprints and better response times.},

	abstract = {Energy-aware compilers are becoming increasingly important for embedded systems due to the need to meet conflicting constraints on time, code size and power consumption. We introduce a trace-based, offline compiler framework on binaries and demonstrate its benefits in supporting energy optimisations. The key innovation lies in identifying frequently executed paths in a binary program and duplicating them as single-entry traces. Separating frequently from infrequently executed paths enables the compiler to focus both performance and energy optimisations on the hot traces.Traces constructed at the level of binaries are inherently inter-procedural, spanning both application and library code. Such a framework allows an embedded application developer to exploit optimisation opportunities made possible due to the information that is available only at link time.We describe the implementation of our trace-based framework in alto, a link-time optimiser for the Alpha architecture. We present a new algorithm for constructing the hot traces from binaries. This algorithm is both effective (since the execution cycles are mostly spent on traces) and practical (due to small code size increases caused). We have developed and implemented a new optimisation to reduce the functional unit leakage energy. We show how the traces facilitate the development of such an optimisation, which results in significant leakage energy savings for benchmark programs at the cost of small performance penalties.},

	abstract = {With the advent of energy-aware scheduling algorithms, it is now possible to find solutions that trade-off performance for decreased energy usage. There are now efficient algorithms to find high quality Pareto fronts that can be used to select the desired balance between makespan and energy consumption. One drawback of this approach is that it still requires a system administrator to select the desired operating point. In this paper, a market-oriented technique for scheduling is presented where the high performance computing system administrator is trying to maximize the return on investment. A model is developed where the users pay a given price to have a bag-of-tasks processed. The cost to the system administrator for processing this bag-of-tasks is strongly related to the energy consumption for executing these tasks. A novel algorithm is designed that efficiently finds the maximum profit resource allocation and tightly bounds the optimal solution. In addition, this algorithm has very desirable runtime and solution quality properties as the number of tasks and machines become large.},

	abstract = {In a software product line (SPL), a collection of software products is defined by their commonalities in terms of features rather than explicitly specifying all products one-by-one. Several verification techniques were adapted to establish temporal properties of SPLs. Symbolic and family-based model checking have been proven to be successful for tackling the combinatorial blow-up arising when reasoning about several feature combinations. However, most formal verification approaches for SPLs presented in the literature focus on the static SPLs, where the features of a product are fixed and cannot be changed during runtime. This is in contrast to dynamic SPLs, allowing to adapt feature combinations of a product dynamically after deployment.The main contribution of the paper is a compositional modeling framework for dynamic SPLs, which supports probabilistic and nondeterministic choices and allows for quantitative analysis. We specify the feature changes during runtime within an automata-based coordination component, enabling to reason over strategies how to trigger dynamic feature changes for optimizing various quantitative objectives, e.g., energy or monetary costs and reliability. For our framework there is a natural and conceptually simple translation into the input language of the prominent probabilistic model checker PRISM. This facilitates the application of PRISM's powerful symbolic engine to the operational behavior of dynamic SPLs and their family-based analysis against various quantitative queries. We demonstrate feasibility of our approach by a case study issuing an energy-aware bonding network device.},

@inproceedings{10.5555/2755753.2755906,
	abstract = {Approximate computing is an emerging design paradigm that exploits the intrinsic ability of applications to produce acceptable outputs even when their computations are executed approximately. In this work, we explore approximate computing for a key computation pattern, Reduce-and-Rank (RnR), which is prevalent in a wide range of workloads including video processing, recognition, search and data mining. An RnR kernel performs a reduction operation (e.g., distance computation, dot product, L1-norm) between an input vector and each of a set of reference vectors, and ranks the reduction outputs to select the top reference vectors for the current input. We propose two complementary approximation strategies for the RnR computation pattern. The first is interleaved reduction-and-ranking, wherein the vector reductions are decomposed into multiple partial reductions and interleaved with the rank computation. Leveraging this transformation, we propose the use of intermediate reduction results and ranks to identify future computations that are likely to have low impact on the output, and can hence be approximated. The second strategy, input similarity based approximation, exploits the spatial or temporal correlation of inputs (e.g., pixels of an image or frames of a video) to identify computations that are amenable to approximation. These strategies address a key challenge in approximate computing -- identification of which computations to approximate -- and may be used to drive any approximation mechanism such as computation skipping and precision scaling to realize performance or energy improvements.A second key challenge in approximate computing is that the extent to which computations can be approximated varies significantly from application to application, and across inputs for even a single application. Hence, quality configurability, or the ability to automatically modulate the degree of approximation at runtime is essential. To enable quality configurability in RnR kernels, we propose a kernel-level quality metric that correlates well to application-level quality, and identify key parameters that can be used to tune the proposed approximation strategies dynamically. We develop a runtime framework that modulates the identified parameters during execution of RnR kernels to minimize their energy while meeting a given target quality. To evaluate the proposed concepts, we designed quality-configurable hardware implementations of 6 RnR-based applications from the recognition, mining, search and video processing application domains in 45nm technology. Our experiments demonstrate 1.06X-2.18X reduction in energy consumption with virtually no loss in output quality (&lt;0.5%) at the application-level. The energy benefits further improve up to 2.38X and 2.5X when the quality constraints are relaxed to 2.5% and 5% respectively.},

We obtain an average of 26% and 10.7% savings in energy consumption of the chip for two HPC mini-applications - miniMD and Jacobi, respectively.

	abstract = {Background. Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products.Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure.Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption.Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency.Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.},

	abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) systems are large-scale computing systems with thousands of compute nodes. Massive energy consumption is a critical issue for HPC systems. In this paper, we develop an auction mechanism model for energy consumption reduction in an HPC system. Our proposed model includes an optimized resource allocation scheme for HPC jobs based on processor frequency and a Vickery-Clarke-Groove (VCG)-based forward auction model to enable energy reduction participation from HPC users. The model ensures truthful participation from HPC users, where users benefit from revealing their true valuation of energy reduction. We implement a job scheduler simulator and our mechanism model on a parallel discrete-event simulation engine. Through trace-based simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our auction mechanism model. Simulation shows that our model can achieve overall energy reduction for an HPC system, while ensuring truthful participation from the users.},

	abstract = {Initially the client server database is created on the cloud. The servers are hereby categorized according to their processing time, speed and RAMs. On the basis of these configurational parameters they are classified as higher, intermediate and lower priority servers. The clients are categorized on basis of job requests and are differentiated into three priority types; viz. high priority, middle priority and low priority depending upon the processing need (time) of the job requests. The client job requests of longer time duration will take more processing time and hence shall be sent to the highest priority (configuration) server. In this paper we present the multilayered job scheduling approach on basis of preferences for both the client and the server. A high priority job request is executed by higher configuration server while the lower tasks are accomplished by the lower configuration servers; that helps in energy saving. If the higher server has finished up with its assigned jobs; then job requests from lower server are migrated to the higher server; which leads to load balancing with effective resource allocation. The overall process has been best illustrated with help of example wherein all the servers will execute the jobs requests in stipulated time. This fast execution helps the servers to free themselves early and results in better energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Software is present in all types of devices, some of them with restrictions as to the amount of energy they can spend to execute software applications. For this reason, energy costs are becoming an important factor during software development and evolution. However, there is still little support for creating energy-efficient software. In this work, we introduce a possible framework for software energy costs evaluation based on model analysis. We model software as Labelled Transitions Systems (LTS) and annotate these models with energy costs, which can be obtained using existing tools. We can then apply graph-based algorithms to traverse the models to obtain information about energy consumption related to software behaviour, such as its most/least costly execution, the cost of a specific execution, and the average cost of executing the software. No existing tool currently provides all the necessary analyses, even though they are essential for energy-consumption evaluation. We have conducted a small experiment with our framework where we employed jRAPL to measure energy costs. We annotated the models with the collected energy costs using an extended version of the LoTuS tool, where we have also implemented some of the desired analyses. Based on this support and on our initial results, we believe developers could create software more energy-efficient and consider possible trade-offs related to time, space, and energy costs when producing new versions of their systems.},

Thus, being able to implement energy optimization in software is essential. This requires a model of the energy utilization---or more general resource utilization---for each component in the system. Optimizer components, then, analyze resource utilization of other components in terms of such a model and adapt their behavior accordingly. We have devised a notation for Resource-Utilization Models (RUMs) that can be part of a component's application programming interface (API) to facilitate the modular implementation of optimizers.

However, mitigating bloat is not easy; efforts are best applied where savings would be substantial. To aid this we develop an analytical model establishing the relation between bottleneck in resources, bloat, performance and power.Analyses with the model places into perspective results from the first experimental study of the power-performance implications of bloat. In the experiments we find that while bloat reduction can provide as much as 40% energy savings, the degree of impact depends on hardware and software characteristics. We confirm predictions from our model with selected results from our experimental study.Our findings show that a software-only view is inadequate when assessing the effects of bloat. The impact of bloat on physical resource usage and power should be understood for a full systems perspective to properly deploy bloat reduction solutions and reap their power-performance benefits.},

These mechanisms limit the power draw and thereby decrease the thermal dissipation of the processors. However, they also have an impact on the achievable performance. The various mechanisms significantly differ regarding the amount of power savings, the latency of mode changes, and the associated overhead. In this paper, we describe and closely examine the so-called software controlled clock modulation mechanism for different processor generations. We present results that imply that the available documentation is not always correct and describe when this feature can be used to improve energy efficiency. We additionally compare it against the more popular feature of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and develop a model to decide which feature should be used to optimize inter-process synchronizations on Intel Haswell-EP processors.},

Processor are nowadays more and more complex and they are used in many hardware systems, such as computers or smartphones. This thesis is thus focusing on the software energy efficiency for multi-core systems. In this paper, we therefore report our motivations to understand deeply their architectures for improving their energy efficiencies. Manufacturers have worked tremendously to improve performance and reduce power consumption of their processors. However a lot of things remains to do in the software side. We claim that energy-efficient softwares can play a deterministic role to reduce the IT carbon footprint. To answer this challenge, we are believing on the software-metric approach with a minimal hardware investment. For this purpose, an efficient, scalable and non-invasive tool is needed. As a result, we created PowerAPI, to provide fine-grained power estimations at process and code-level for optimizing the software enegergy efficiency automatically. This solution will help to identify clearly the energy leaks for optimizing automatically the power consumed by software.},

	abstract = {Ever-growing performance of supercomputers nowadays brings demanding requirements of energy efficiency and resilience, due to rapidly expanding size and duration in use of the large-scale computing systems. Many application/architecture-dependent parameters that determine energy efficiency and resilience individually have causal effects with each other, which directly affect the trade-offs among performance, energy efficiency and resilience at scale. To enable high-efficiency management for large-scale High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems nowadays, quantitatively understanding the entangled effects among performance, energy efficiency, and resilience is thus required. While previous work focuses on exploring energy-saving and resilience-enhancing opportunities separately, little has been done to theoretically and empirically investigate the interplay between energy efficiency and resilience at scale. In this article, by extending the Amdahl's Law and the Karp-Flatt Metric, taking resilience into consideration, we quantitatively model the integrated energy efficiency in terms of performance per Watt and showcase the trade-offs among typical HPC parameters, such as number of cores, frequency/voltage, and failure rates. Experimental results for a wide spectrum of HPC benchmarks on two HPC systems show that the proposed models are accurate in extrapolating resilience-aware performance and energy efficiency, and capable of capturing the interplay among various energy-saving and resilience factors. Moreover, the models can help find the optimal HPC configuration for the highest integrated energy efficiency, in the presence of failures and applied resilience techniques.},

	abstract = {In pervasive computing environments, understanding the context of an entity is essential for adapting the application behavior to changing situations. In our view, context is a high-level representation of a user or entity's state and can capture location, activities, social relationships, capabilities, etc. Inherently, however, these high-level context metrics are difficult to capture using uni-modal sensors only and must therefore be inferred using multi-modal sensors. A key challenge in supporting context-aware pervasive computing is how to determine multiple high-level context metrics simultaneously and energy-efficiently using low-level sensor data streams collected from the environment and the entities present therein. A key challenge is addressing the fact that the algorithms that determine different high-level context metrics may compete for access to low-level sensors. In this paper, we first highlight the complexities of determining multiple context metrics as compared to a single context and then develop a novel framework and practical implementation for this problem. The proposed framework captures the tradeoff between the accuracy of estimating multiple context metrics and the overhead incurred in acquiring the necessary sensor data streams. In particular, we develop two variants of a heuristic algorithm for multi-context search that compute the optimal set of sensors contributing to the multi-context determination as well as the associated parameters of the sensing tasks e.g., the frequency of data acquisition. Our goal is to satisfy the application requirements for a specified accuracy at a minimum cost. We compare the performance of our heuristics with a brute-force based approach for multi-context determination. Experimental results with SunSPOT, Shimmer and Smartphone sensors in smart home environments demonstrate the potential impact of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Workflows are a popular application model used for representing scientific as well as commercial applications, and cloud data centers are increasingly used in the execution of workflow applications. Existing approaches to energy-efficient workflow scheduling in cloud computing environments have primarily focused on the optimization of server utilization. The majority of works have ignored the impact of scheduling decisions on the data center network (DCN). However, studies have revealed that the DCN consumes 10-20% of the total data center power, and this percentage could rise much higher depending on the utilization level of the data center. This paper proposes an energy-efficient workflow scheduling approach (J-OPT) that jointly optimizes the power consumption of servers and networking elements in cloud data centers. J-OPT considers precedence constraints and data dependencies among workflow tasks as well as communication requirements among task instances in the formulation of topology-aware scheduling decisions. The proposed approach is evaluated using synthetic and real world workflow traces in a simulated environment. Results of the experiments demonstrate that J-OPT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of total power savings by 8% and 30% under high and low data center utilization levels, respectively.},

	abstract = {New designing techniques are used recently during the design phases of buildings to adapt the environment and achieve human thermal comfort, one of these designing techniques is using energy simulation software's. However, architects need to understand the capabilities of these software's and its operation systems, when it comes to designing and modelling passive buildings. Moreover the validity of the design outcomes which is the main concern of this research. These energy simulation software's helps architects to estimate the building's energy efficiency in order to achieve human thermal comfort. This study will focus on studding and analyzing one of the well-known simulation software's used for building's energy simulations which is called "Design-Builder". The presented research will measure the accuracy of Design-Builder outcomes by comparing the accuracy of the thermal simulation in Design-Builder software to the results obtained from the experimental data. A Bookstore kiosk located in El-Sherouk city, Cairo, Egypt was chosen to be the study area of this research. The research will compare the simulation results of this Kiosk to the field's experimental measurements obtained from site visit. The results reveled that there is differences between the field measurements and the simulation ranged between 1 to 5$\,^{\circ}$C. The study analyzed the causes of these differences and provided some proposals to improve Design-Builder software in order to provide more accurate data in simulating hot arid climates.},

This is done in a structured and flexible way, allowing for easy exploitation of different points in the quality/energy space, without adversely affecting application performance. The runtime system can apply a number of different policies to decide whether it will execute less-significant tasks accurately or approximately. The experimental evaluation indicates that our system can achieve an energy reduction of up to 83% compared with a fully accurate execution and up to 35% compared with an approximate version employing loop perforation.

In particular, interconnecting hundreds of cores, caches, integrated memory and I/O controllers in energy efficient way stands out as a new challenge. This paper proposes hierarchical on-chip networks that take the proximity advantage between the cores in smaller clusters as a promising approach toward energy-efficient high performance computing. The design trade-offs of hierarchical interconnect architectures are studied using a fast and scalable design space exploration tool for exascale systems with number of cores in the order of thousands. In particular, we consider a system with 720 processing nodes and two-level network hierarchy. By supporting both traditional cache-based memory model and scratch pad memory (SPM) model, the target system architecture proves to be a good testbed for energy-guided exploration of hierarchical networks.},

	abstract = {High Throughput Computing allows workloads of many thousands of tasks to be performed efficiently over many distributed resources and frees the user from the laborious process of managing task deployment, execution and result collection. However, in many cases the High Throughput Computing system is comprised from volunteer computational resources where tasks may be evicted by the owner of the resource. This has two main disadvantages. First, tasks may take longer to run as they may require multiple deployments before finally obtaining enough time on a resource to complete. Second, the wasted computation time will lead to wasted energy. We may be able to reduce the effect of the first disadvantage here by submitting multiple replicas of the task and take the results from the first one to complete. This, though, could lead to a significant increase in energy consumption. Thus we desire to only ever submit the minimum number of replicas required to run the task in the allocated time whilst simultaneously minimising energy. In this work we evaluate the use of fixed replica counts and Reinforcement Learning on the proportion of task which fail to finish in a given time-frame and the energy consumed by the system.},

	abstract = {Future computing clusters will prevalently run parallel workloads to take advantage of the increasing number of cores on chips. In tandem, there is a growing need to reduce energy consumption of computing. One promising method for improving energy efficiency is co-scheduling applications on compute nodes. Efficient consolidation for parallel workloads is a challenging task as a number of factors, such as scalability, inter-thread communication patterns, or memory access frequency of the applications affect the energy/performance tradeoffs. This paper evaluates the impact of co-scheduling parallel workloads on the energy consumed per useful work done on real-life servers. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel multi-level technique that selects the best policy to co-schedule multiple workloads on a multi-core processor. Our measurements demonstrate that the proposed multi-level co-scheduling method improves the overall energy per work savings of the multi-core system up to 22% compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {Reducing energy consumption has become a key issue for data centres, not only because of economical benefits but also for environmental and marketing reasons. Many approaches tackle this problem from the point of view of different hardware components, such as CPUs, storage and network interface cards (NIC). To this date, few works focused on the energy consumption of network transfers at the software level comprising their complete stacks with different energy characteristics, and the way the NIC selection impacts the energy consumption of applications. Since data centres often install multiple NICs on each node, investigating and comparing them at the software level has high potential to enhance the energy efficiency of applications on Cloud infrastructures. We present a comparative analysis of the energy consumption of the software stack of two of today's most used NICs in data centres, Ethernet and Infiniband. We carefully design for this purpose a set of benchmark experiments to assess the impact of different traffic patterns and interface settings on energy consumption. Using our benchmark results, we derive an energy consumption model for network transfers and evaluate its accuracy for a virtual machine migration scenario. Finally, we propose guidelines for NIC selection from an energy efficiency perspective for different application classes.},

	abstract = {Software energy consumption has emerged as a growing concern in recent years. Managing the energy consumed by a software is, however, a difficult challenge due to the large number of factors affecting it -- namely, features of the processor, memory, cache, and other hardware components, characteristics of the program and the workload running, OS routines, compiler optimisations, among others. In this paper we study the relevance of numerous architectural and program features (static and dynamic) to the energy consumed by software. The motivation behind the study is to gain an understanding of the features affecting software energy and to provide recommendations on features to optimise for energy efficiency.In our study we used 58 subject desktop programs, each with their own workload, and from different application domains. We collected over 100 hardware and software metrics, statically and dynamically, using existing tools for program analysis, instrumentation and run time monitoring. We then performed statistical feature selection to extract the features relevant to energy consumption. We discuss potential optimisations for the selected features. We also examine whether the energy-relevant features are different from those known to affect software performance. The features commonly selected in our experiments were execution time, cache accesses, memory instructions, context switches, CPU migrations, and program length (Halstead metric). All of these features are known to affect software performance, in terms of running time, power consumed and latency.},

The problem is complex to be solved, especially in asynchronous replicated system, since one should first provide a good prediction scheme on the performance evaluation of resource selection model in the presence of job that update data before the energy-efficiency issue can be addressed. With this in mind and by observing that simplicity implies efficiency and scalability, two approaches of energy-aware resource selection are proposed and developed. The main objective is to minimize the energy consumption while still preserves a minimum system performance degradation trade-offs. The proposed approaches exploit both the presence and the absence of knowledge on resource energy usage to select the best resources to run the job. Also, they take advantage on the nature of high performance of job execution in asynchronous replicated system in its resource selection decision making process. The experimental results proved that the proposed approaches are able to minimize resource energy usage while preserving minimum performance degradation trade-offs.},

The goal of this article is to explore the use of computational storage to address such challenges by distributed near-data processing. We describe Newport, a high-performance and energy-efficient computational storage developed for realizing the full potential of in-storage processing. To the best of our knowledge, Newport is the first commodity SSD that can be configured to run a server-like operating system, greatly minimizing the effort for creating and maintaining applications running inside the storage. We analyze the benefits of using Newport by running complex AI applications such as image similarity search and object tracking on a large visual dataset. The results demonstrate that data-intensive AI workloads can be efficiently parallelized and offloaded, even to a small set of Newport drives with significant performance gains and energy savings. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of existing computational storage solutions together with a realistic cost analysis for high-volume production, giving a good big picture of the economic feasibility of the computational storage technology.},

The Roadrunner project was started as a development project aimed at finding a way to scale up applications but at a significantly more efficient energy usage than the current systems. Heterogeneous core types allow single thread performance to remain high while reducing the energy required for a given computation by eliminating the circuits and associated power that are not needed for the computation. This optimizes the energy cost per operation but puts a burden on the software to deal with heterogeneous core types.The Roadrunner system was the first to reach a sustained Petaflop on the Linpack benchmark and it involved some interesting new Hardware but the bulk of the effort was in Software development including programming models and applications. Several applications were ported to the new structure with relatively little difficulty and the expected performance and energy efficiency improvements were attained.This talk will cover an overview of the Roadrunner project, including the fundamental Cell BE building block and the software structure and methods that were included. The success of the energy efficiency improvement has lead to a broader view of the utility of heterogeneous computing in the Computationally Intensive Workload area.},

Nowadays, energy efficiency is as important as performance and has become a critical aspect to the development of scalable systems. These strict energy constraints paved the way for the development of multi and manycore processors. Research on the performance and the energy efficiency of numerical kernels on multicores are common but studies in the context of manycores are sparse. Unlike these works, in this paper we analyze a well-known irregular NP-complete problem, the Traveling-Salesman Problem (TSP). This study investigates two aspects of the TSP on multicore, NUMA, and manycore processors. First, we concentrate on the nontrivial task of adapting this application to a manycore, specifically the novel MPPA-256 manycore processor. Then, we analyze its performance and energy consumption on different platforms that comprise general-purpose and low-power multicores, a NUMA machine, and the MPPA-256 manycore. Our results show that applications able to fully use the resources of a manycore can have better performance and may consume 9.8 and 13 times less energy when compared to low-power and general-purpose multicore processors, respectively.},

Now electricity is used both to power the computing hardware and to remove the heat computing generates. On the other hand, heating is needed e.g. for buildings and for hot water. However, reusing heat from data centers, e.g. for district heating, is complicated and expensive because of relatively low temperature of exhaust heat and a need for expensive infrastructure investments. In this paper, we will study the feasibility and the technical solutions for distributing computing to where heating is needed.

	abstract = {It is increasingly challenging to improve single thread performance because power/energy consumption becomes a major barrier to achieve significantly higher performance for general purpose cores. General purpose processors are designed to perform well in a wide variety of market segments, at the cost of having significantly lower performance-per-watt than special purpose processors targeting limited applications or market segments. In this paper, we propose a HW/SW co-designed heterogeneous multi-core virtual machine, called TwinPeaks, which integrates a set of less general but power efficient cores and uses dynamic binary optimization to schedule code regions to run on the most efficient cores. Our experiment and analysis indicate that TwinPeaks with a wide in-order core and a narrow out-of-order core may achieve 108% performance at ˜71% energy of a big 4-wide out-of-order core.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing utilizes arbitrary mega-scale computing infrastructures and is currently revolutionizing the ICT landscape by allowing remote access to computing power and data over the Internet. Besides the huge economical impact Cloud technology exhibits a high potential to be a cornerstone of a new generation of sustainable and energy-efficient ICT. The challenging issue thereby is the energy-efficient utilization of physical machines (PMs) and the resource-efficient management of virtual machines (VMs) while attaining promised non-functional qualities of service expressed by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Currently, there exist solutions for PM power management, VM migrations, and dynamic reconfiguration of VMs. However, most of the existing approaches consider each of them alone, and only use rudimentary concepts for migration costs or disrespect the nature of the highly volatile workloads. In this paper we present an integrated approach for VM migration and reconfiguration, and PM power management. Thereby, we incorporate an autonomic management loop, where proactive actions are suggested for all three areas in a hierarchically structured way. We evaluate our approach with both, synthetic workload data and real-word monitoring data of a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) application used for the protein folding in the bioinformatics area. The efficacy of our approach is evaluated by considering classical algorithms like First Fit, Monte Carlo and Vector Packing, adapted for energy-efficient reallocation. The results show energy savings up to 61.6% while keeping acceptably low SLA violation rates.},

	abstract = {Software engineers are plagued by the same troubles as many others in highly skilled jobs and digitized environments: Ever-expanding to-do lists, time to market pressure from management, deadline-driven development, continuous interruption during working tasks, and the juggle of balancing that with other areas of life (physical, mental and emotional health, family, household, finance, friends, hobbies and community service). These demands of life in combination with a seemingly ever-increasing pace wear or burn out many people in the long run. Specifically, as software engineers, this also leads to decreased creativity and less efficiency in problem-solving. Generally offered solutions are reducing screen time and spending more time outdoors, both of which are hard to do within the work of a software engineer. On a meta level, if the developers of the systems that run most of our world do not develop individual sustainability with a balanced pace of life, that imbalance propagates into the systems we develop (similar to Conway's Law). We argue that mindfulness practices like yoga poses (asanas), breathing practices, and meditation exercises can help individually, and even more effectively in combination. In this exploratory paper, we discuss related work that explores the application of these mitigations in other application domains and propose a research agenda to explore their use within software engineering education and practice.Engaging with mindfulness practices in the context of software engineering promises to enhance creativity and cognitive problem-solving skills, leading to more efficiency and effectiveness during software development and increased individual sustainability. This, in turn, leads to better team spirit as well as increased economic profit, both in terms of maintaining human capital and customer contract deliverables.},

	abstract = {The steadily increasing success of Cloud Computing is causing a huge rise in its electrical power consumption, contributing to higher energy costs, as well as to the greenhouse effect and the global warming. One of the most common key strategies to reduce the power consumption of data centers is the consolidation of virtual machines, whose effectiveness strongly depends on a reliable forecasting of future computational resource needs. In fact, servers are typically configured to handle peak workload conditions even if they are often under-utilized, that results in a wastefulness of resources and inefficient energy consumption. Motivated by these issues, this paper describes a data-driven approach based on autoregressive models to dynamically forecast virtual machine workloads, for energy-aware allocations of virtual machines on Cloud physical nodes. Virtual machine migrations across physical servers are periodically done on the basis of the estimated virtual machine demands, by minimizing the number of active servers. Experimental results show encouraging benefits in terms of energy saving, while satisfying performance constraints and service level agreement established with users.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of energy debt: a new metric, reflecting the implied cost in terms of energy consumption over time, of choosing a flawed implementation of a software system rather than a more robust, yet possibly time consuming, approach. A flawed implementation is considered to contain code smells, known to have a negative influence on the energy consumption.Similar to technical debt, if energy debt is not properly addressed, it can accumulate an energy "interest". This interest will keep increasing as new versions of the software are released, and eventually reach a point where the interest will be higher than the initial energy debt. Addressing the issues/smells at such a point can remove energy debt, at the cost of having already consumed a significant amount of energy which can translate into high costs. We present all underlying concepts of energy debt, bridging the connection with the existing concept of technical debt and show how to compute the energy debt through a motivational example.},

Visualizing the aforementioned information and bringing it together in one application can help organizations in understanding and adapting their energy consumption behavior in order to better support environmentally sustainable practices. The purpose of this project, from a power analytics standpoint, is twofold: (1) it aims to provide users with insight into their device's current power consumption without leaving a footprint on their machine, and (2) to analyze if one method gives more accurate results than others.

	abstract = {In this contribution two cloud server clusters are considered which process virtualized user service requests defined as Virtual Machines (VM) operated under the Hypervisor control. Load Balancing (LB) is applied to avoid temporary overloads and to enforce negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLA) defined by means and percentiles of processing delays. Two novel LB strategies are defined through which the two server clusters perfform job processing cooperatively through mutual job overflows by a "Local Server System First" (LSSF) and through a "Shortest Response Time First" (SRTF) strategy, respectively. The cooperation operation is performed by VM migration at the instant of VM scheduling by the Hypervisor. Both LB models are defined by queuing systems which are analyzed by the method of Markov-Chains. Energy efficiency has been analyzed by the authors through server consolidation, server sleep modes, and through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), c.f. [1-5]. In this contribution another method is studied which is based on a flexible VM migration to a common server cluster by which the total number of servers can be reduced making use of the effect of the economy of scale by server aggregation.},

Moreover, Cielo theoretically guarantees that each application performs an evolutionarily stable deployment strategy, which is an equilibrium solution under given operational conditions. Simulation results verify this theoretical analysis; applications seek equilibria to perform adaptive and evolutionarily stable deployment strategies.

This paper adds to previous ones as it considers elastic underlying infrastructure, that is, we propose a PaaS solution which efficiently utilize the elasticity nature at both infrastructure and application levels, by leveraging adaptation in facing to changing condition i.e., workload burst, performance degradation, quality of energy, etc. While applications are adapted by dynamically re-configuring their service level based on performance and/or green energy availability, the infrastructure takes care of addition/removal of resources based on application's resource demand. Both adaptive behaviors are implemented in separated modules and are coordinated in a sequential manner.We validate our approach by extensive experiments and results obtained over Grid'5000 test bed. Results show that, application can reduce significant amount of brown energy consumption by 35% and daily instance hour cost by 37% compared to a baseline approach when green energy aware adaptation is considered.},

In this paper, we provide a quantitative comparison and evaluation of the interaction of two hardware cache optimization mechanisms (block buffering and sub-banking) and three widely used compiler optimization techniques (linear loop transformation, loop tiling, and loop unrolling). Our results show that the pure hardware optimizations (eight block buffers and four sub-banks in a 4K, 2-way cache) provided up to 4% energy saving, with an average saving of 2% across all benchmarks. In contrast, the pure software optimization approach that uses all three compiler optimizations, provided at least 23% energy saving, with an average of 62%. However, a closer observation reveals that hardware optimization becomes more critical for on-chip cache energy reduction when executing optimized codes.},

Grounded in inventories, interview and plug energy data from 33 undergraduate student participants, our findings provide the context for assessing approaches to reducing the energy and carbon emissions of media and IT in the home. In the paper, we use the findings to discuss and inform more fruitful directions that sustainable HCI research might take, and we quantify how various strategies might have modified the energy and emissions impacts for our participants.},

However, the steady growth in the ICT sector has meanwhile a significant ecological footprint: 2% of global CO2 emissions are due to ICT systems already today - one fourth of the emissions caused by cars. The energy costs for running ICT infrastructure have turned into a significant economical factor. The most urgent challenge in the area of micro and nanotechnology is therefore to massively increase energy efficiency, in particular for ICT as a key sector for economic growth. Significant improvements in this area can only be achieved through disruptive innovations and new system approaches, which rely on a combination of excellent research &amp; development and world leading know-how of semiconductor production.But will hardware be the driver to fulfill these requirements and software has to adapt to whatever hardware concepts are developed? Or should the ability to program systems energy-efficiently define the design of the hardware architecture? This session will present the different perspectives on the problem and try to bring both sides together.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to present an energy-conserving, self-adaptive Commodity Green Cloud Storage, called Lightning. Lightning's File System dynamically configures the servers in the Cloud Storage into logical Hot and Cold Zones. Lightning uses data-classification driven data placement to realize guaranteed, substantially long, periods (several days) of idleness in a significant subset of servers designated as the Cold Zone, in the commodity datacenter backing the Cloud Storage. These servers are then transitioned to inactive power modes and the resulting energy savings substantially reduce the operating costs of the datacenter. Furthermore, the energy savings allow Lightning to improve the data access performance by incorporation of high-performance, though high-cost Solid State Drives (SSD) without exceeding the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the datacenter. Analytical cost model analysis of Lightning suggests savings in the upwards of $24 million in the TCO of a 20,000 server datacenter. The simulation results show that Lightning can achieve 46% energy costs reduction even when the datacenter is at 80% capacity utilization.},

In this study, a literature survey and comparison was conducted using three-phases, having as a starting point the comparison of basic models for software quality. A follow-up study, conducted at a more comprehensive level to cover both basic models and the most cited tailored models., Software sustainability literature is investigated to find the most frequent characteristics. Finally, data gathered from these studies and a comparison shows a similarity in the top level of these characteristics between software sustainability and software quality, and the emphasis on sustainability, maintainability and portability. The study suggests that ISO 25010 can be utilised by software sustainability.

Improving the energy efficiency of data centers has become a necessity. In this paper, in order to improve the energy efficiency of both IT and cooling systems for data centers, a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based joint optimization approach MACEEC is proposed. To improve the cooperation between IT and cooling system while handling the high-dimensional state space and the large hybrid discrete-continuous action space, a hybrid AC-DDPG multi-agent structure is developed. A scheduling baseline comparison method is proposed to enhance the stability of the architecture. And an asynchronous control optimization algorithm is developed to solve the different responding time issue between IT and cooling system. Experiments based on real-world traces data validate that MACEEC can effectively improve the overall energy efficiency for data centers while ensuring the temperature constraint and service quality compared with existing joint optimization approaches.},

	abstract = {Cloud platforms' growing energy demand and carbon emissions are raising concern about their environmental sustainability. The current approach to enabling sustainable clouds focuses on improving energy-efficiency and purchasing carbon offsets. These approaches have limits: many cloud data centers already operate near peak efficiency, and carbon offsets cannot scale to near zero carbon where there is little carbon left to offset. Instead, enabling sustainable clouds will require applications to adapt to when and where unreliable low-carbon energy is available. Applications cannot do this today because their energy use and carbon emissions are not visible to them, as the energy system provides the rigid abstraction of a continuous, reliable energy supply. This vision paper instead advocates for a "carbon first" approach to cloud design that elevates carbon-efficiency to a firs--class metric. To do so, we argue that cloud platforms should virtualize the energy system by exposing visibility into, and software-defined control of, it to applications, enabling them to define their own abstractions for managing energy and carbon emissions based on their own requirements.},

	abstract = {Context: It is impossible to imagine our everyday and professional lives without software. Consequently, software products, especially socio-technical systems, have more or less obvious impacts on almost all areas of our society. For this purpose, a group of scientists worldwide has developed the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF) which examines the impacts on five interrelated dimensions: social, individual, environmental, economic, and technical. According to this framework, we should design software to maintain or improve the Sustainability Impacts. Designing for sustainability is a major challenge that can profoundly change the field of activity -- particular for Software Engineers. Objectives: The aim of the thesis work is to analyze the current role of Software Engineers and relate it to Sustainability Impacts of Software Products in order to contribute to this paradigm shift. This should provide a basis for follow-up works. The question in which direction exactly the Software Engineer should develop and how exactly this path can be followed is still owed by the scientific community. Perhaps universities will have to adapt the curriculum in the training of Software Engineers, politics could possibly initiate support programs in the field of sustainability for software companies, or maybe software sustainability certifications could emerge. In any case, Software Engineers must adapt to the times and acquire the necessary knowledge, the skills and the competencies. Results: The results of the dissertation are a better understanding of the needed paradigm shift of Software Engineers and complement the SusAF that to better support sustainability design. The extended SusAF is intended for both training and corporate use.},

	abstract = {Many organizations follow the same error-prone, time-consuming, and redundant procedures to install software manually, whether as part of a master image or on individual computers. Usually this involves visiting a system, executing some sort of interface, selecting a subset of modules or configuring certain options, and waiting for the installer to complete. There is another way: automated software deployment, which affords greater efficiency, consistency, and ultimately, service. This paper discusses the organization and detailed implementation of automating software installations and updates using silent and unattended methods, with various levels of administrative intervention, from help desk to systems administrator. We also describe different approaches to creating such an environment for both "mass" devices (e.g., public computer lab systems) and individual devices (e.g., faculty/staff desktop systems).Key concepts include leveraging management software and resources you may already have (i.e., the "zero budget" approach) versus efficiency gains from third-party resources, high-level administrative toolkits along with low-level control methods, and developing a workflow for automated and semi-automated software installations.},

	abstract = {Sustainability has emerged as a broad concern for society. Many engineering disciplines have been grappling with challenges in how we sustain technical, social and ecological systems. In the software engineering community, for example, maintainability has been a concern for a long time. But too often, these issues are treated in isolation from one another. Misperceptions among practitioners and research communities persist, rooted in a lack of coherent understanding of sustainability, and how it relates to software systems research and practice. This article presents a cross-disciplinary initiative to create a common ground and a point of reference for the global community of research and practice in software and sustainability, to be used for effectively communicating key issues, goals, values and principles of sustainability design for software-intensive systems. The centrepiece of this effort is the Karlskrona Manifesto for Sustainability Design, a vehicle for a much needed conversation about sustainability within and beyond the software community, and an articulation of the fundamental principles underpinning design choices that affect sustainability. We describe the motivation for developing this manifesto, including some considerations of the genre of the manifesto as well as the dynamics of its creation. We illustrate the collaborative reflective writing process and present the current edition of the manifesto itself. We assess immediate implications and applications of the articulated principles, compare these to current practice, and suggest future steps.},

However, for computing to be truly sustainable, all phases of the system life-cycle must be considered. In contrast to the considerable effort that has been applied to address the use-phase energy consumption issue---ranging from battery powered embedded systems to data center servers---there is limited awareness or attention to the considerable energy consumption and environmental impacts from semiconductor fabrication. Current research indicates that fabrication is responsible for a significant factor of the energy utilized by these systems throughout their life-cycle. The trends of technology scaling coupled with developing hybrid fabrication solutions for integration of emerging technologies, while beneficial for use-phase power consumption, exacerbate these increasing environmental impacts from fabrication. Thus, design for sustainability is a grand challenge that must be addressed over the next decade.},

The quality of software architectures determines sustainability to a large extent. Scenario-based software architecture evaluation methods can support sustainability analysis, but they are still reluctantly used in practice. They are also not integrated with architecture-level metrics when evaluating implemented systems, which limits their capabilities. Existing literature reviews for architecture evaluation focus on scenario-based methods, but do not provide a critical reflection of the applicability of such methods for sustainability evaluation. Our goal is to measure the sustainability of a software architecture both during early design using scenarios and during evolution using scenarios and metrics, which is highly relevant in practice. We thus provide a systematic literature review assessing scenario-based methods for sustainability support and categorize more than 40 architecture-level metrics according to several design principles. Our review identifies a need for further empirical research, for the integration of existing methods, and for the more efficient use of formal architectural models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel energy-aware and temperature-aware programming model with first-class support for sustainability. A program written in the new language, named Eco, may adaptively adjusts its own behaviors to stay on a given (energy or temperature) budget, avoiding both deficit that would lead to battery drain or CPU overheating, and surplus that could have been used to improve the quality of results. Sustainability management in Eco is captured as a form of supply and demand matching, and the language runtime consistently maintains the equilibrium between supply and demand. Among the efforts of energy-adaptive and temperature-adaptive systems, Eco is distinctive in its role in bridging the programmer and the underlying system, and in particular, bringing both programmer knowledge and application-specific traits into energy optimization. Through a number of intuitive programming abstractions, Eco reduces challenging issues in this domain --- such as workload characterization and decision making in adaptation --- to simple programming tasks, ultimately offering fine-grained, programmable, and declarative sustainability to energy-efficient computing. Eco is an minimal extension to Java, and has been implemented as an open-source compiler. We validate the usefulness of Eco by upgrading real-world Java applications with energy awareness and temperature awareness.},

	abstract = {From 1991 to 2015, 60 papers published in the ASE and SCAM conferences introduced static analysis prototypes or tools as academic software developed to support research. In this study, we characterize such academic software concerning sustainability. We performed an exploratory study regarding publicization (whether the software is available from an explicitly given URL in a software publication), evolution stage (initial development, evolution, servicing, phase-out or close-down), and recognition (the way others mention the software in their papers). Thereby, we discussed the results under the umbrella of software sustainability. Results for the academic software for static analysis published at ASE and SCAM, show that 40% are not publicly available from the URL informed by the authors; 78% are in an initial development stage, discontinued, or closed-down; 23% has no mentions in relevant digital libraries besides the original software publication, but 30% received contributions to their source code. We observed that a large number of academic static analysis software has inadequate publicization, short life cycles and low recognition. A systematic analysis of publicization, software life cycle, and recognition of academic software is viable, and its results may be useful to support rapid decision-making on adopting academic software for use or even as a target for contribution. The results may also promote a more inclusive view of scientific reputation with respect to the academic software produced by researchers.},

	abstract = {The underlying principles of Sustainable Software Engineering are a core set of competencies Software Engineers need for defining, building, and running sustainable software applications. However, despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be challenging to understand the value of the principles behind sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice. Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might trigger further discussions around the SSD's underlying principles and concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.},

Consequently, Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S) has developed as an active area of research. Objective/Aim: Though SE4S gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions, there is only one rigorous survey of the field. We follow up on this systematic mapping study from 2012 with a more in-depth overview of the status of research, as most work has been conducted in the last 4 years. Method: The applied method is a systematic mapping study through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas are most explored, and which research type facets have been used, to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art in SE4S. Results: We contribute an overview of current research topics and trends, and their distribution according to the research type facet and the application domains. Furthermore, we aggregate the topics into clusters and list proposed and used methods, frameworks, and tools. Conclusion: The research map shows that impact currently is limited to few knowledge areas and there is need for a future roadmap to fill the gaps.},

	abstract = {Sustainability has been defined variously as the perpetual maintenance of diverse and productive environments upon which all life depends (Renewable Natural Resources Foundation); the responsible use of resources over an indefinite period of time (National Association of Biology Teachers); or "meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (World Commission on Environment and Development)" A sustainable future depends on a workforce of professionals knowledgeable about creating practices, processes, and infrastructure to optimize resource management, and on a community informed about the ethics and influence of human activity on the integrated environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainability. For these reasons we believe that STEM education, which includes computing, is key to developing the knowledge, the technology, the skills, the motivation and the policies needed for a sustainable future. SIGCSE is one of eleven professional societies involved in the Sustainability Improves Student Learning (SISL) project, which seeks to engage those who teach computing in an effort to include sustainability ideas throughout the computing curriculum.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing pervasiveness of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) not only is determining radical changes in everyone's life-style, in the social organizations, and in the economic dynamics, but it is causing relevant direct and indirect effects on the environment as well. One of the aspects not yet sufficiently addressed in literature is the sustainability of the software lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on the sustainability management of software development projects. In the practice, software development projects are managed by considering principally parameters as time, costs and quality of work products. We propose a methodological approach aimed at identifying sustainability indicators to be used in project management to set up sustainability objectives for a software development project, to control their achievement during the project itself and, possibly, to adopt corrective actions to maintain the project aligned with them. The availability of such sustainability indicators may contribute to reduce the carbon footprint of the activities performed in software development projects as well as to speed-up the development of a green culture in organizations developing software.},

The pilot study was then used as a foundation for further discussing and developing the revised taxonomy into yet another, third and final version which we have chosen to call the Sustainable Computing Evaluation Framework (SCEF). While our proposed framework (SCEF) is more practically useful than Toyama's "preliminary taxonomy", there are still challenges that need to be addressed and we end the paper by suggesting where future efforts could be focused.},

However, issues exist, including vagueness and complexity of the concept itself, in addition to immaturity of the Software Engineering (SE) field. Aims: The study surveys respondents on software sustainability dimensions and characteristics from their perspectives, and seeks to derive rankings for their priority. Method: An exploratory study was conducted to quantitatively investigate Saudi Arabian (KSA) software user's perceptions with regard to the concept itself, the dimensions and characteristics of the software sustainability. Survey data was gathered from 906 respondents. Results: The results highlight key dimensions for sustainability and their priorities to users. The results also indicate that the characteristics perceived to be the most significant, were security, usability, reliability, maintainability, extensibility and portability, whereas respondents were relatively less concerned with computer ethics (e.g. privacy and trust), functionality, efficiency and reusability. A key finding was that females considered the environmental dimension to be more important than males. Conclusions: The dimensions and characteristics identified here can be used as a means of providing valuable feedback for the planning and implementation of future development of sustainable software.},

	abstract = {To reduce the negative environmental implications (e.g., <em>CO</em> 2 emission and global warming) caused by the rapidly increasing energy consumption, many Internet service operators have started taking various initiatives to operate their cloud-scale data centers with renewable energy. Unfortunately, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and solar panels, currently renewable energy is often more expensive than brown energy that is produced with conventional fossil-based fuel. As a result, utilizing renewable energy may impose a considerable pressure on the sometimes stringent operation budgets of Internet service operators. Therefore, two key questions faced by many cloud-service operators are 1) how to dynamically distribute service requests among data centers in different geographical locations, based on the local weather conditions, to maximize the use of renewable energy, and 2) how to do that within their allowed operation budgets.In this paper, we propose GreenWare, a novel middleware system that conducts dynamic request dispatching to maximize the percentage of renewable energy used to power a network of distributed data centers, subject to the desired cost budget of the Internet service operator. Our solution first explicitly models the intermittent generation of renewable energy, e.g., wind power and solar power, with respect to varying weather conditions in the geographical location of each data center. We then formulate the core objective of GreenWare as a constrained optimization problem and propose an efficient request dispatching algorithm based on linear-fractional programming (LFP). We evaluate GreenWare with real-world weather, electricity price, and workload traces. Our experimental results show that GreenWare can significantly increase the use of renewable energy in cloud-scale data centers without violating the desired cost budget, despite the intermittent supplies of renewable energy in different locations and time-varying electricity prices and workloads.},

	abstract = {A recent study found that IT contributes about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, in line with that of the aviation industry. Furthermore, it projected that that this share would double by the year 2020. Increasing environmental concern and regulatory action will soon force a paradigm shift in how IT solutions are designed and managed across their lifecycles. Data centers are a prominent and fast growing component of this impact.To address these concerns, we propose the development of a suite of technologies for a sustainable data center (SDC). The goal is to reduce the environmental footprint of a data center to such an extent that the services it offers are more environmentally friendly than conventional services offered within today's state-of-the-art facilities.Developing and demonstrating a SDC requires the multi-disciplinary collaboration of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, computer scientists, and others. The compute infrastructure of the data center consists of thousands of servers hosting revenue-generating services, interconnected with each other and the outside world via networking equipment, and relying on storage devices for persistent data. The data center also has a power infrastructure that feeds electricity to all of the equipment, and a cooling infrastructure that removes heat from the equipment. The economic and environmental burden of the latter two infrastructures can often equal that of the compute infrastructure.All of these infrastructures, and many of their components, have traditionally been designed and managed independently, resulting in unnecessary redundancy and waste. For example, CRAC units are often provisioned in high availability (tier 4) data centers at twice the required capacity. This is to ensure sufficient backup cooling capacity in the event of failure. However, we have previously shown how to map the thermal zones of influence for each CRAC, and how to identify regions of the data center that naturally have high levels of cooling redundancy. Using such thermal zones, hardware can be provisioned to services based on availability and reliability requirements. For example, critical workloads can be placed within regions of the data center that are served by multiple thermal zones. The economic and environmental benefit of eliminating a redundant standby CRAC unit illustrates the type of advantage that can be garnered through integration of the compute and cooling infrastructures in the data center. Similarly integrating design and management of an entire data center, both within and across its compute, power, and cooling infrastructures, is crucial to improved operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact.We identify five principles for integrated design and management that cut across all three infrastructures, and indeed cut across the multiple disciplines that are needed to achieve this goal. This talk will describe each of these five principles and discuss how they can be employed to improve IT and data center sustainability.},

	abstract = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},

	abstract = {As the digitalization of the military conflicts increases, gaining decision superiority become the key to enhance the likelihood of success, which among others is enabled by bringing to the tactical edge emerging ICT paradigms like advanced data fusion, Artificial Intelligence, distributed computation or end-to-trust. Based on them, Tactical Clouds will allow the provisioning of C3 services for enhancing the development of the tactical pillars of modern join military operations, like Intelligence, Surveillance, Situational Awareness, or support to decision-making. But the adoption of new technological enablers bring novel and unexplored challenges that when no remediated, may jeopardize the operability of the digital tactical assets, being the cyber defence an essential cornerstone for their safeguarding. In these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and analyze the denial of sustainability problem on tactical combat clouds; which entails a rara avis topic on the existing bibliography among other due to the novelty, secrecy and low level of technological maturity on their related digital enablers. The research presents and scoping action that developed the following secondary objectives: 1) to frame the denial of sustainability threats on the emerging Tactical Cloud paradigm; 2) to formalize the Tactical Denial of Sustainability (TDoS) concept; 3) to introduce the phasing, potential attack surfaces, terrains and impact of TDoS attacks; 4) to illustrate heterogeneous CONOPS that facilitate the understanding of TDoS; and 5) to raise and encourage the development of further research topics and actions.},

	abstract = {Making energy consumption data accessible to software developers is an essential step towards energy efficient software engineering. The presence of various different, bespoke and incompatible, methods of instrumentation to obtain energy readings is currently limiting the widespread use of energy data in software development. This paper presents EACOF, a modular Energy-Aware Computing Framework that provides a layer of abstraction between sources of energy data and the applications that exploit them. EACOF replaces platform specific instrumentation through two APIs---one accepts input to the framework while the other provides access to application software. This allows developers to profile their code for energy consumption in an easy and portable manner using simple API calls. We outline the design of our framework and provide details of the API functionality. In a use case, where we investigate the impact of data bit width on the energy consumption of various sorting algorithms, we demonstrate that the data obtained using EACOF provides interesting, sometimes counter-intuitive, insights. All the code is available online under an open source license. http://github.com/eacof},

	abstract = {Cloud computing plays a significant role in today's network computing by delivering virtualized resources as pay-as-you-go services over the Internet. However, the growing demand drastically increases the energy consumption of data centers, which has become a prominent problem. Hence, energy efficient solutions are required to minimize system power consumption and increase the availability of computational resources and obviously reduce the operational expenses. In this paper we present ENAGS (Energy and Network-Aware Genetic Scheduling algorithm) to minimize the energy consumption of servers and reduce the network traffic. The proposed algorithm takes into account communication dependencies among VMs and computational requirements of tasks to improve communication performance and minimize the energy consumption by maximizing the resource utilization. Our experimental results show that the proposed ENAGS algorithm can reduce data center energy consumption as well as network traffic by approximately 38% compared to other placement algorithms.},

	abstract = {Many applications, such as machine learning and data sensing are statistical in nature and can tolerate some level of inaccuracy in their computation. Approximate computation is a viable method to save energy and increase performance by trading energy for accuracy. There are a number of proposed approximate solutions, however, they are limited to a small range of applications because they cannot control the error rate of their output. In this paper, we propose a novel approximate floating point multiplier, called CFPU, which significantly reduces energy and improves performance of multiplication at the expense of accuracy. Our design approximately models multiplication by replacing the most costly step of the operation with a lower energy alternative. In order to tune the level of approximation, CFPU dynamically identifies the inputs which will produce the largest approximation error and processes them in precise CFPU mode. We showed that our CFPU can outperforms a standard FPU when at least 4% of multiplications are performed in approximate mode. In our tested applications this percentage of multiplications is substantially higher, leading to significant energy savings. Our experimental evaluation on AMD Southern Island GPU shows that replacing the proposed CFPU with traditional FPUs results in 77% energy savings and 3.5x energy-delay product improvement over eight general OpenCL applications while providing acceptable quality of service. In addition, for the same level of accuracy, the CFPU provides 2.4x energy-delay product improvement compared to state-of-the-art approximate multipliers.},

Big Data compute model mandates strong data-locality for computational performance, and moves computations to data. State-of-the-art cooling energy management techniques rely on thermal-aware computational job placement/migration and are inherently data-placement-agnostic in nature. T* takes a novel, data-centric approach to reduce cooling energy costs and to ensure thermal-reliability of the servers. T* is cognizant of the uneven thermal-profile and differences in thermal-reliability-driven load thresholds of the servers, and the differences in the computational jobs arrival rate, size, and evolution life spans of the Big Data placed in the cluster. Based on this knowledge, and coupled with its predictive file models and insights, T* does proactive, thermal-aware file placement, which implicitly results in thermal-aware job placement in the Big Data analytics compute model. Evaluation results with one-month long real-world Big Data analytics production traces from Yahoo! show up to 42% reduction in the cooling energy costs with T* courtesy of its lower and more uniform thermal-profile and 9x better performance than the state-of-the-art data-agnostic cooling techniques.},

Hence, ICT applications are optimized to provide the best possible user satisfaction for the least possible energy budget. An inevitable prerequisite for such optimizations is the ability to analyze software's energy consumption. In consequence, many energy profiling frameworks have been developed. The problem we address in this paper is that profiling frameworks are device- and application-specific and, hence, cannot be reused. We analyze the key requirements of energy profiling frameworks and propose a generic framework reusable for different devices and applications, designed according to these requirements.

	abstract = {Approximate computing aims to trade accuracy for energy efficiency. Various approximate methods have been proposed in the literature that demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxing accuracy requirements in a specific unit. This provides a basis for exploring simultaneous use of multiple approximate units to improve efficiency under guarantees on quality of results. In this paper, we explore the effect of combining multiple approximate units on the energy consumption and identify the best setting that minimizes energy consumption under a quality constraint. Our approach also enables changes in unit configurations throughout the program. To do this effectively, we need a method to examine the combined impact of multiple approximate units on the output quality, and configure individual units accordingly. To solve this problem, we propose LEMAX that uses gradient descent approach to identify the best configuration of the individual approximate units for a given program. We evaluate the efficacy of LEMAX in minimizing the energy consumption of several machine learning applications with varying size (i.e., number of operations) under different quality constraints. Our evaluation shows that the configuration provided by LEMAX for a system with multiple approximate units improves the energy consumption by on average, 97.7%, 83.12%, and 73.95% for quality loss of 5%, 2% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to configurations obtained for a system with a single approximate resource.},

	abstract = {The recent restructuring of the electricity grid (i.e., smart grid) introduces a number of challenges for today's large-scale computing systems. To operate reliable and efficient, computing systems must adhere not only to technical limits (i.e., thermal constraints) but they must also reduce operating costs, for example, by increasing their energy efficiency. Efforts to improve the energy efficiency, however, are often hampered by inflexible software components that hardly adapt to underlying hardware characteristics. In this paper, we propose an approach to bridge the gap between inflexible software and heterogeneous hardware architectures. Our proposal introduces adaptive software components that dynamically adapt to heterogeneous processing units (i.e., accelerators) during runtime to improve the energy efficiency of computing systems.},

However, the power efficiency of OLED screens greatly depends on the luminance and colors of the displayed contents on the screen. Web browsing is one of the most widely used applications in mobile devices. In this paper, we present our cloud service, which intelligently re-paints the web pages in real-time with power efficient colors and HVS (Human Visual System) based tone mapping techniques, without adversely affecting the identity (brand color) of the web pages as well as the user's browsing experience. El-pincel helps to save up to 60% of OLED energy with color combinations that ensure good legibility and pleasing affective response to human eyes.},

	abstract = {Spintronics is one of the leading technologies under consideration for the post-CMOS era. While spintronic memories have demonstrated great promise due to their density, non-volatility and low leakage, efforts to realize spintronic logic have been much less fruitful. Recent studies project the performance and energy efficiency of spintronic logic to be considerably inferior to CMOS. In this work, we explore Stochastic Computing (SC) as a new direction for the realization of energy-efficient logic using spintronic devices. We establish the synergy between stochastic computing and spintronics by demonstrating that (i) the peripheral circuits required for SC to convert to/from stochastic domains, which incur significant energy overheads in CMOS, can be efficiently realized by exploiting the characteristics of spintronic devices, and (ii) the low logic complexity and fine-grained parallelism in SC circuits can be leveraged to alleviate the shortcomings of spintronic logic. We propose Spintastic, a new design approach in which all the components of stochastic circuits --- stochastic number generators, stochastic arithmetic units, and stochastic-to-binary converters --- are realized using spintronic devices. Our experiments on a range of benchmarks from different application domains demonstrate that Spintastic achieves 2.8X improvement in energy over CMOS stochastic implementations and 1.9X over a CMOS binary baseline.},

	abstract = {While persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. This criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. We join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. Based on our six-month long ethnography with the Islamic communities in a Bangladeshi city, Kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. Drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how Islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. We further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of CSCW literature in the various domains.},

However, teaching students from software engineering and related disciplines to effectively act in this space requires interdisciplinary courses that combines the concept of sustainability with software engineering practice and principles. Yet, presently little guidance exist on which subjects and materials to cover in such courses and how, combined with a lack of reusable learning objects. This paper describes a summer school course on Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S). We provide a blueprint for this course, in the hope that it can help the community develop a shared approach and methods to teaching SE4S. Practical lessons learned from delivery of this course are also reported here, and could help iterate over the course materials, structure, and guidance for future improvements. The course blueprint, availability of used materials and report of the study results make this course viable for replication and further improvement.},

	abstract = {As new IT systems and devices pervade all aspects of human routines, several new paradigms have recognized groups of IT systems as forming an ecosystem. As a result, the term "IT ecosystem" has been coined. Each individual system participating in an IT ecosystem has, to a varying degree, autonomy. The ultimate goal of participating systems is to satisfy the global goal of the entire IT ecosystem in which they are participating. In order to maintain autonomy and controllability over an IT ecosystem through environmental changes, orchestration strategies must be invented and implemented. In this paper, we propose a reference orchestration architecture framework, which we call ITE Arbitrator, to support IT ecosystems in accomplishing the goals of individual participant systems while simultaneously achieving system-wide goals. ITE Arbitrator provides a mechanism to decide on an adaptation strategy with an optimal configuration of available systems to satisfy local constraints while achieving its global goal. We use the detailed simulation example of an unmanned forest management IT ecosystem to show how the proposed framework orchestrates inter-system interaction against environmental changes and sustains stable service.},

	abstract = {Energy creates 35% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1]. Information technology (IT) is a significant end user of energy, consuming over 10% of commercial electricity [2]. 0.37GtCO2e of IT GHG emissions are attributed to end user computing (EUC) devices, such as desktop computers and notebooks [3]. The United Nations (UN) indicates combining existing technology innovative and behavioural changes has the potential to transform societies and reduce GHG emissions [4]. As the commercial and public sector transitions from desktops to notebooks [5], accurately identifying energy efficient mobile devices offers the ability to support this concept by reducing concomitant GHG emissions. However, accurately measuring device use phase energy (UPE) generated GHG emissions is elusive. Organisations currently avoid the direct measurement due to scale, complexity and logistical issues that cause the practice to become costly and therefore impractical [6]. As an alternative, EUC energy consumption is estimated based on typical electricity consumption (TEC) benchmark data, extrapolated by the number of users and then converted to GHG equivalent units. Conducting a field experiment measuring EUC energy consumption in a business environment, this research substantiates that accepted estimation methods introduce an error range between -48% to +107%. Consequently, the error causes EUC GHG scope 2 accounting to be underestimated by 30% and abatement opportunities of up to 55% to be overlooked.},

@article{ZHANG2019147,
	abstract = {To reduce the price of pay-as-you-go style cloud applications, an increasing number of cloud service providers offer resource reservation-based services that allow tenants to customize their virtual machines (VMs) with specific time windows and physical resources. However, due to the lack of efficient management of reserved services, the energy efficiency of host physical machines cannot be guaranteed. In today's highly competitive cloud computing market, such low energy efficiency will significantly reduce the profit margin of cloud service providers. Therefore, how to explore energy efficient VM allocation solutions for reserved services to achieve maximum profit is becoming a key issue for the operation and maintenance of cloud computing. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel and effective evolutionary approach for VM allocation that can maximize the energy efficiency of a cloud data center while incorporating more reserved VMs. Aiming at accurate energy consumption estimation, our approach needs to simulate all the VM allocation updates, which is time-consuming using traditional cloud simulators. To overcome this, we have designed a simplified simulation engine for CloudSim that can accelerate the process of our evolutionary approach. Comprehensive experimental results obtained from both simulation on CloudSim and real cloud environments show that our approach not only can quickly achieve an optimized allocation solution for a batch of reserved VMs, but also can consolidate more VMs with fewer physical machines to achieve better energy efficiency than existing methods. To be specific, the overall profit improvement and energy savings achieved by our approach can be up to 24% and 41% as compared to state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Moreover, our approach could enable the cloud data center to serve more tenant requests.},

	abstract = {Cloud-based content distribution networks (CDNs) consist of multiple servers that consume large amounts of energy. However, with the development of a cloud-based software defined network (SDN), a new paradigm of the virtual content distribution network (vCDN) has emerged. In an emerging cloud-based vCDN environment, the development and adjustment of vCDN components has become easier with the aid of SDN technology. This transformation provides the opportunity to use vCDNs to reduce energy consumption by adjusting the scale of the vCDN components. Energy costs can be reduced by deactivating the commercial servers carrying the software components of the vCDN, such as replica servers, the firewall or routers. In addition, the CDN requires a high service level agreement (SLA) to respond to clients' requests, potentially consuming large amounts of energy. In this research, we focus on the issue of the energy savings of a CDN in a cloud computing environment while maintaining a high quality of service (QoS). We propose an approximate algorithm termed max flow forecast (MFF) to determine the number of software components in the vCDN. Additionally, we use a real traffic trace from a website to assess our algorithm. The experimental results show that MFF can produce a larger energy reduction than the existing algorithms for an identical SLA. We fully justify our research as a good example for the emerging cloud.},

	abstract = {To meet the growing demands on cloud services and applications, a sizeable number of large scale cloud data centers, hosting thousands of heterogeneous servers, is established by cloud service providers. The ever growth in establishing cloud data centers is accompanied by consuming enormous amounts of energy. Thus, proposing efficient management approaches to reduce the energy consumption in cloud data centers becomes a top priority for ensuring the scalability of the cloud computing architecture. In general, the main source of energy overconsumption in today's data centers is due to the inefficient use of the physical servers' resources, which results in poor server utilization patterns. So, the key aspect is to utilize the physical resources optimally while serving the cloud user demands. This paper investigates the design and implementation of virtual machine management strategies for energy efficient cloud data centers. Particularly, it considers the processes of virtual machine placement and virtual machine consolidation in enhancing the energy efficiency in cloud infrastructures. While addressing the virtual machine placement problem is important, virtual machine consolidation is even more important to enable continuous reorganization of the already-placed virtual machines on the least number of physical machines. This results in reducing the number of active physical machines by leveraging live virtual machine migration enabled by the virtualization concept. Moreover, since the virtual machine migration operations consume additional energy, the frequency of VM migrations needs to be limited and controlled as well. The paper presents a distributed approach to an energy-efficient dynamic virtual machine consolidation mechanism. This approach determines, based on novel algorithms, which virtual machines to migrate, and when. Then, the placement of the virtual machines selected for migration is achieved based on a generalization of the Knapsack Problem known as the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem. The placement process suits both static and dynamic virtual machine placement. The results of the performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed new algorithms are able to enhance the energy efficiency in cloud data centers.},

This selection is addressed by our Cloud-SEnergy, a system that uses a bin-packing technique to generate the most efficient service composition plans. Experiments were conducted to compare Cloud-SEnergy's efficiency with 5 established techniques in multi-cloud environments (All clouds, Base cloud, Smart cloud, COM2, and DC-Cloud). The results gained from the experiments demonstrate a superior performance of Cloud-SEnergy which ranged from an average energy consumption reduction of 4.3% when compared to Based Cloud technique, to an average reduction of 43.3% when compared to All Clouds technique. Furthermore, the percentage reduction in the number of examined services achieved by Cloud-SEnergy ranged from 50% when compared to Smart Cloud and average of 82.4% when compared to Base Cloud.

	abstract = {The last decade witnessed a dramatic advance in cloud computing research and techniques. One of the key challenges in this field is reducing the massive amount of energy consumption in cloud computing data centers. Many power-aware virtual machine (VM) allocation and consolidation approaches were proposed to reduce energy consumption efficiently. However, most of the existing efficient cloud solutions save energy at the cost of significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a strategy to calculate the optimized working utilization levels for host computers. As the performance and power data need to be measured on real platforms, to make our design practical, we propose a strategy named ``PPRGear'' which is based on the sampling of utilization levels with distinct Performance-to-Power Ratios (PPR) calculated as the number of Server Side Java operations completed during a certain time period divided by the average active power consumption in that period. In addition, we present a framework for virtual machine allocation and migration which leverages the PPR for various host types. By achieving the optimal balance between host utilization and energy consumption, our framework is able to ensure that host computers run at the most power-efficient utilization levels, i.e., the levels with the highest PPR, thus tremendously reducing energy consumption with ignorable sacrifice of performance. Our extensive experiments with real world traces show that compared with three baseline energy-efficient VM allocation and selection algorithms, IqrMc, MadMmt, and ThrRs, our framework is able to reduce the energy consumption up to 69.31% for various host computer types with fewer migration times, shutdown times, and little performance degradation for cloud computing data centers.},

They cannot be used to achieve significant power optimization in High Performance Computing (HPC) systems such as grids, and cloud datacenters; because power saved by scaling down the processor voltage is far less than switching off a machine. Resource management, using dynamic consolidation of VMs, allows cloud service providers to optimize resource usability, performance and decrease power consumption. This paper investigates various resource management techniques, and suggests several heuristic approaches to optimise energy consumption and performance in elastic datacenters. Using real workload datasets, our evaluation suggests that a combination of the proposed VM allocation and consolidation with migration control technique could save approximately 1.96%--9.38% energy, and improve 0.32%--5.96% performance, as compared to its closest rivals.},

	abstract = {In general, cloud environments are based on the pay-per-use model, whereby clients pay for the information resources provided by cloud service providers. Users rent and use resources as needed while avoiding the high costs of large-scale resource acquisitions, and providers maximize their profits by managing information resources at a minimum cost while upholding service-level agreements. As the number of resources gradually increases, power supply shortages may arise. This study focuses on the fact that the CPU utilization rate of the server running in the data center is less than 30% and idle servers running only the OS consume more than half of the power consumed by hosts running with maximum CPU utilization and speed. Therefore, this study proposes an approach to enhance data center efficiency through improved management of energy consumption. We present a method to minimize energy consumption while processing the same workload, i.e., ultimately reducing the energy consumed by operating servers. Energy consumption and SLA violation rate were used as evaluation metrics of the optimization model to meet the minimum performance target.},

	abstract = {With rapid development of cloud computing technologies and applications, the number and scale of cloud data centers have grown exponentially in recent years. One of the major problems with current cloud data centers is their huge energy consumption, which makes energy consumption management one of the hottest research topics in the field of cloud computing. This paper aims at implementing an effective Distributed Energy Meter (DEM) system for heterogeneous cloud environments based on a multi-component power consumption model for cloud servers. Specifically, we propose a modeling method for the energy consumption of key components (CPU, memory and disk) of computer servers and reveal the mathematical relationship between the resource usage of the key components and the system energy consumption. The proposed DEM system cannot only estimate the energy consumption of heterogeneous cluster environments (Linux and Windows NT), but also support various CPU power consumption models. In addition, a unique disk power consumption model that uses different thresholds to distinguish various disk I/O states (sequential/random, read/write) to achieve an accurate estimation of disk power consumption. Experimental studies conducted on a heterogeneous cluster with workloads generated by PCMark and Sysbench demonstrate that the proposed DEM system outperforms the state-of-art models in estimating the energy consumption of heterogeneous cloud environments.},

	abstract = {Energy proportionality is the key design goal followed by architects of multicore processors. One of its implications is that optimization of an application for performance will also optimize it for energy. In this work, we show that energy proportionality does not hold true for multicore processors. This finding creates the opportunity for bi-objective optimization of applications for energy and performance. We propose and study a novel application-level bi-objective optimization method for energy and performance for multithreaded dataparallel applications. The method uses two decision variables, the number of identical multithreaded kernels (threadgroups) executing the application and the number of threads per threadgroup, with a given workload partitioned equally between the threadgroups. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the method using four popular and highly optimized multithreaded data-parallel applications, two employing two-dimensional fast Fourier transform and the other two, dense matrix multiplication. The experiments performed on four modern multicore processors show that the optimization for performance alone results in increase in dynamic energy consumption by up to 89% and optimization for dynamic energy alone results in performance degradation by up to 49%. By solving the bi-objective optimization problem, the method determines up to 11 Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, we propose a qualitative dynamic energy model employing performance events as variables to explain the discovered energy nonproportionality. The model shows that the energy nonproportionality on our experimental platforms for the two data-parallel applications is due to disproportionately energy expensive activity of the data translation lookaside buffer.},

	abstract = {Reducing energy consumption in cloud data centers is one of the prime issue in the cloud community. It reduces energy related costs and increases lifespan of high performance computing resources deployed in cloud data centers and it also helps in reducing carbon emissions. Along with energy efficiency, problem of task scheduling is also one of the important problem considered in cloud data centers and it belongs to NP-class problems. With the energy consumption consideration, problem of task scheduling becomes more complex to solve. Metaheuristic algorithms are proven to generate near optimal solutions for task scheduling problem but their scheduling overhead increases vastly as the number of tasks or number of resources increases. In addition to this, metaheuristic-based scheduling algorithms lives most of time in local-optimal region of solution space and it is possible that it can finalizes the solution in the local-optimal region only. Primary motivation behind this work is from genetic algorithm itself, we have experimented with genetic algorithm in many ways to solve the problem of energy efficient task scheduling and come up with new hybrid scheme to solve it. In this work, we tackles the problem of energy efficient task scheduling on modern cloud data center architecture and proposes a novel hybrid metaheuristic scheme harmony-inspired genetic algorithm (HIGA). It also addresses issues associated with metaheuristic algorithm. HIGA combines the exploration capability of genetic algorithm and exploitation capability of harmony search by which it intelligently senses local as well as global optimal region without wasting time (iterations) in local or global optimal region and provides quick convergence. Our primary objectives in this work are to reduce makespan and computing energy and secondary objectives are to reduce the energy consumed by the resources other than computing resources and reduce execution overhead associated with scheduler. Collectively these objectives guides HIGA for better energy efficiency and performance while reducing the number of required resources (i.e. active racks). It indirectly also reduces cooling energy as we can switch off the rack components (air blower, cooling inlets) once racks become idle. Simulation analysis has been performed over independent task applications as well as real-world scientific applications like CyberShake, Epigenomics and Montage. The result clearly manifests that proposed HIGA provides by up to 33% of energy savings and 47% of improvement in application performance (makespan) that too with 39% less execution overhead.},

The nature of such systems often results in energy-related problems that have to be solved for sustainability, cost reduction, and environment protection. In this paper we defined and developed a set of performance and energy-aware strategies for resource allocation, task scheduling, and for the hibernation of virtual machines. The idea behind this model is to combine energy and performance-aware scheduling policies in order to hibernate those virtual machines that operate in idle state. The efficiency achieved by applying the proposed models has been tested using a realistic large-scale CC system simulator. Obtained results show that a balance between low energy consumption and short makespan can be achieved. Several security constraints may be considered in this model. Each security constraint is characterized by: (a) Security Demands (SD) of tasks; and (b) Trust Levels (TL) provided by virtual machines. SD and TL are computed during the scheduling process in order to provide proper security services. Experimental results show that the proposed solution reduces up to 45% of the energy consumption of the CC system. Such significant improvement was achieved by the combination of an energy-aware scheduler with energy-efficiency policies focused on the hibernation of VMs.},

However, due to the increasing chip density, lowering CPU voltages improperly in cloud data centers may inevitably increase soft error rate during workflow execution. Consequently, failures of timely completion of workflow applications may often take place, which raises serious concerns during the operation and maintenance of cloud data centers. To address such a problem, this paper proposes a soft error-aware energy-efficient task scheduling approach for workflow applications in DVFS-enabled cloud data centers. Under reliability and completion time constraints requested by tenants, our approach can generate energy-efficient task schedules for workflows by allocating tasks to appropriate virtual machines with specific operating frequencies. Comprehensive experiments on various well-known scientific workflow benchmarks show the effectivenss of our approach. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach can achieve more than 30% energy savings while satisfying both reliability and completion time requirements.},

We measure the energy consumption using Power-API; an application programming interface (API) written in Java to monitor the energy consumed at the process-level. Results show that cloud patterns can effectively reduce the energy consumption of a cloud-based application, but not in all cases. In general, there appear to be a trade-off between an improved response time of the application and the energy consumption.

The literature on thermally-aware workload management provides strategies to reduce this energy cost, while typically ignoring the reduction in cooling capacity due to thermodynamic irreversibility and computing performance per unit energy consumption. Hence, we provide an approach that considers coefficient of performance COPc, exergy efficiency ηex, and a new metric, computing performance ratio CPR. In contrast to existing methods that consider one-dimensional workload distributions, the temperature predictions from a physics-based zonal model are used to optimize cooling for two-dimensional workload distributions in a multi-rack DC. The investigation reveals physics associated with two-dimensional workload management for multi-rack DCs, provides a framework for trade-offs between COPc, ηex, and CPR, explains the influence of IT load factor LF on different objectives, and describes how parameters obtained from single- and multi-objective problems can vary. Our findings show that COPc, and ηex can be improved by up to 20% and 8% by regulating the chilled water temperature and airflow setpoints while increasing the LF degrades the CPR by 7.5%.

Such a meteorological Cloud mainly provides computing resources for the execution of meteorological models, such as Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). In a meteorological Cloud, the parallelism of tasks (i.e., meteorological models) can only be configured in the beginning, and the assigned resources retained exclusively until all sub-tasks have been finished. For the scheduling of those tasks, one key challenge is how to reduce the average energy consumption while guaranteeing others requirements of such tasks. We address this challenge by considering simultaneously the deadlines of tasks, the energy consumption, the system load, and the non-linear speedup of parallel tasks when we make the scheduling decision. Specifically, we propose an adaptive energy-aware scheduling method called ASSD, that is based on the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) model of computing resources and the speedup of tasks under different parallelisms. We evaluate our method via simulations on a meteorological cloud. Our results show that the proposed method not only increases the number of completed tasks but also significantly reduces the average energy consumption.},

	abstract = {The adoption of Green Information Technology (GIT) is important to ensure organizations' environmental performance through sustainable production, consumption, utilization and disposal of Information Technology (IT) devices. However, research on the adoption of GIT practices has mostly addressed organizational factors and outcomes, with limited emphasis on the cognitive and attitudinal factors associated with behavioral change. Based on the Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework, this research examined the effects of individual, social and organizational factors on GIT attitude among a sample of IT professionals in ISO 14001 certified IT companies in Malaysia and investigated the mediating effects of their beliefs about GIT. Further, this research investigated the relationship between GIT attitudes and behavioral change, as indicated through self-reported engagement in green computing practices. Survey methods were used to collect data from 333 respondents. The results support the direct effects of GIT knowledge, social influence and green management culture on GIT attitude. However, hypothesized indirect effects through the mediation of GIT beliefs were supported for GIT knowledge and social influence, but not for green management culture. The relationship between GIT attitude and engagement in green computing practices was supported. The implications of these results are discussed, and future research directions are suggested.},

However, much of that energy is wasted to maintain excess service capacity during periods of low load. In this paper, we investigate the problem of ``right-sizing'' data center for energy-efficiency through virtualization which allows consolidation of workloads into smaller number of servers while dynamically powering off the idle ones. In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics. Solving this model, we notice that there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption and performance. We hereby develop a BFGS based algorithm to optimize the tradeoff by searching for the optimal system parameter values for the data center operators to ``right-size'' the data centers. We implement our Stochastic Right-sizing Model (SRM) and deploy it in the real-world cloud data center. Experiments with two real-world workload traces show that SRM can significantly reduce the energy consumption while maintaining high performance.},

Several cloud simulation frameworks have been proposed during the last years, focusing on various components of the cloud resources.

	abstract = {The increasing demand of cloud computing motivates the researchers to make cloud environment more efficient for its users and more profitable for the providers. Though virtualization technology helps to increase the resource utilization, still the operational cost of cloud gradually increases mainly due to the consumption of large amount of electrical energy. So to reduce the energy consumption virtual machines (VM) are dynamically consolidated to lesser number of physical machines (PMs) by live VM migration technique. But this may cause SLA violation and the provider is penalized. So to maintain an energy-performance trade-off, the number of VM migration should be minimized. VM migration primarily takes place in two cases: for hotspot mitigation and to switch off the underutilized nodes by migrating all its VMs. If a host is found to be overloaded then instead of immediately migrating some of its VMs we can check whether the migration is really required or not. For this we have proposed a load prediction algorithm to decide whether the migration will be performed or not. After the decision has been taken the algorithm finds a suitable destination host where the VM will be shifted. For this we have proposed a novel approach to decide whether a particular host is suitable as destination depending on its probable future load. We have simulated our algorithms in CloudSim using real world workload traces and compared them with the existing benchmark algorithms. Results show that the proposed methods significantly reduce the number of VM migration and subsequent energy consumption while maintaining the SLA.},

In this paper, we show the considerable impact that RAM can have on the total energy consumption, particularly in servers with large amounts of this memory.

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a scale-based computing model, and requires more physical machines and consumes an extremely large amount of electricity, which will reduce the profit of the service providers and harm the environment. Virtualization is widely used in cloud computing nowadays. However, existing energy efficient scheduling methods of virtual machines (VMs) in cloud cannot work well if the physical machines (PMs) are heterogeneous and their total power is considered, and typically do not use the energy saving technologies of hardware, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). This paper proposes an energy efficient scheduling algorithm, EEVS, of VMs in cloud considering the deadline constraint, and EEVS can support DVFS well. A novel conclusion is conducted that there exists optimal frequency for a PM to process certain VM, based on which the notion of optimal performance--power ratio is defined to weight the homogeneous PMs. The PM with higher optimal performance--power ratio will be assigned to VMs first to save energy. The process of EEVS is divided into some equivalent schedule periods, in each of which VMs are allocated to proper PMs and each active core operates on the optimal frequency. After each period, the cloud should be reconfigured to consolidate the computation resources to further reduce the energy consumption. The deadline constraint should be satisfied during the scheduling. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm achieves over 20% reduction of energy and 8% increase of processing capacity in the best cases.},

However, the growth potential of these data-centers is limited by their corresponding energy consumption and thermal issues. Energy efficiency becomes a key issue of building large-scale cloud computing centers. To solve this issue, we propose a standalone SOPC (System on a Programmable Chip) based platform for cloud applications. We improve the energy efficiency for cloud computing platforms with two techniques. First, we propose a massive-sessions optimized TCP/IP hardware stack using a macro-pipeline architecture. It enables the hardware acceleration of pipelining execution of network packet offloading and application level data processing. This achieves higher energy efficiency while maintaining peak performance. Second, we propose a online dynamic scheduling strategy. It can reconfigure or shut down FPGA nodes according to workload variance to reduce the runtime energy consumption in a standalone SOPC based reconfigurable cluster system. Two case studies including a webserver application and a cloud based ECG (electrocardiogram) classification application are developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed platform. Evaluation results show that our SOPC based cloud computing platform can achieve up to 418X improvement in terms of energy efficiency over commercial cloud systems.},

Therefore, even with regards to internal IaaS behaviour, production clouds only adopt novel ideas that are proven not to hinder established service levels. To analyse their expected behaviour, new ideas are often evaluated with simulators in production IaaS system-like scenarios. For instance, new research could enable collaboration amongst several layers of schedulers or could consider new optimisation objectives such as energy consumption. Unfortunately, current cloud simulators are hard to employ and they often have performance issues when several layers of schedulers interact in them. To target these issues, a new IaaS simulation framework (called DISSECT-CF) was designed. The new simulator's foundation has the following goals: easy extensibility, support energy evaluation of IaaSs and to enable fast evaluation of many scheduling and IaaS internal behaviour related scenarios. In response to the requirements of such scenarios, the new simulator introduces concepts such as: a unified model for resource sharing and a new energy metering framework with hierarchical and indirect metering options. Then, the comparison of several simulated situations to real-life IaaS behaviour is used to validate the simulator's functionality. Finally, a performance comparison is presented between DISSECT-CF and some currently available simulators.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of Cloud Computing provides consumers and service providers with a wide range of opportunities and challenges. Considering the substantial infrastructure investments being made by cloud providers, the reduction of operating expenses (OPEX) while maximizing the profit of the provided services is of great importance. One way to achieve this is by maximizing the efficiency of resource utilization. However, profit maximization does not necessarily coincide with the improvement of a user's Quality of Service (QoS); users generating higher profit for the provider may be scheduled first, causing high delays to low-paying users. Further, the contradictory nature of users' and providers' needs also extends to the energy consumption problem, as the minimization of service delays could cause cloud resources to be constantly ``on'', leading to high energy consumption, high costs for providers and undue environmental impact. The objective of our work is to analyze this multi-dimensional trade-off. We first investigate the problem of efficient resource allocation strategies for time-varying traffic, and propose a new algorithm, MinDelay, which aims at achieving the minimum service delay while taking into account provider's profit. Then, we propose E-MinDelay, an energy-efficient approach for CPU-intensive tasks in cloud systems. Furthermore, we propose an improved version of the Energy Conscious Task Consolidation (ECTC) algorithm, which combines task consolidation and migration techniques with E-MinDelay. Our results demonstrate that energy consumption and service delays corresponding to profit loss can be simultaneously decreased using an efficient scheduling algorithm.},

In particular this is true for those having periodical or variable tasks to execute, and, choose to not or cannot afford the expenses of buying and managing computing facilities or software packages, that should remain underutilized for most of the time. For their ability to couple the scalability offered by public service providers, with the wider Quality of Service (QoS) provisions and ad-hoc customizations provided by private Clouds, Hybrid Clouds (HC) seem a particularly appealing solution for customers requiring something more than the mere availability of the service. The paper firstly introduces a Cloud brokering system leveraging on a promising architectural approach, based on the use of a gateway toolkit. This approach provides noticeably advantages, both to customers and to Cloud Brokers (CB), for its ability to hide all the intricacies related to the management of powerful, but often complex and heterogeneous infrastructures like the Cloud. Moreover such approach, through customized interfaces, facilitates customers in accessing Cloud resources thus easing the tailored deployment and execution of their applications and workflows. The major contribution of this work is given by the analysis of a set of brokering strategies for Hybrid Clouds, implemented by a brokering algorithm, aimed at the execution of various applications subject to different user requirements and computational conditions. With the objective of firstly maximize both user satisfaction and CB's revenues the algorithm also pursues profit increases through the reduction of energy costs by adopting energy saving mechanisms. A simulation model is used to evaluate performance, and the results show that differences among strategies depend on type and size of system loads and that the use of turn on and off techniques greatly improves energy savings at low and medium load rates thus indirectly increasing CB revenues without diminishing customers' satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Abstract
This paper considers the scenario of a cloud service market where several Cloud Service Providers (CSP) are in operation and are competing against each other to attract and serve the demands generated by the customers. The competition arises from the fact that the customers (the individuals or organizations) who generate demand for services in the market rationally choose the CSP which offers good quality of services at a lower price. For pricing the services offered by the CSPs under this framework, we provide an analytical framework by considering the operational cost incurred by the CSP to service the given demand, the quality of service (QoS) offered and the prices other CSPs are charging. The pricing strategy we propose strikes a reasonable balance between charging too little which would result in irrationally low business profit and charging too much which would result in customer loss and thereby eventually loss of market share. In addition, the pricing strategy proposed promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy integration using a bi-level optimization strategy. The first level consisting of a Slow Timescale Optimization Procedure (STOP) addresses the economic efficiency related issues for cloud service pricing. The second level involving a Fast Timescale Optimization Procedure (FTOP) performs energy efficient job scheduling. We carry out numerical simulations to validate the proposed pricing strategy and compare it with an oracle benchmark policy, with fair profit sharing among the CSPs. We compare the proposed energy aware scheduling policy with a baseline scheduling policy. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed bi-level strategy and discuss the results.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has become an attractive platform, offering on-demand computing resources and storage capacity for both personal and commercial use. However, the data centers hosting these clouds use a staggering amount of energy, making energy consumption a major expense. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous clouds, energy consumption varies significantly, owing to the heterogeneity of hardware and software. Therefore, to reduce a data center's energy consumption, our approach leverages knowledge of the power consumption behavior of the underlying hardware and the characteristics of workloads in order to increase their overall energy efficiency. Our ultimate goal is to provide a scheduling mechanism that allows cloud providers to reduce the energy consumption of their data centers without needing to replace the underlying hardware, and to do so seamlessly, without impacting clients' performance requirements. In this paper, we introduce RESCUE, an energy-aware scheduler for heterogeneous cloud environments. RESCUE ranks nodes within the cloud based on their application-specific energy efficiency (ASEE), which implies the correlation between the various hardware and software and the energy efficiency. According to ASEE, RESCUE can assign the whole workload to the most energy-efficient machine while keeping the same performance. We evaluated RESCUE on a private cloud using three benchmarks: BS Seeker, Matrix Stressmark, and TPC-W. We implemented RESCUE with Eucalyptus and compared the energy consumed using RESCUE as the scheduling policy to the other Eucalyptus built-in policies: Round Robin and Greedy. The results show that with a nonaggressive control policy where the machine remains in active mode (ACPI C0 state), RESCUE reduces the overall energy consumption by up to 16.7% on average for BS Seeker and Matrix Stressmark, while for TPC-W, RESCUE saves up to 6.6% of the total energy. Furthermore, with an aggressive control policy that set the idle machines in ``sleep'' mode (ACPI S3 state), RESCUE-with-sleep can further reduce the total energy consumption by 51.5% for BS Seeker, 48.8% for Matrix Stressmark, and 21.3% for TPC-W compared to RESCUE.},

	abstract = {This paper consider the case of a cloud service provider (CSP) who owns multiple geographically distributed data centers, with collocated sources of renewable energy. We investigate load distribution strategies to minimize electricity cost and increase renewable incorporation subject to compliance with service level agreement (SLA), considering the adverse effects of switching the servers. Our work provides some insights on the performance of different algorithms for geographical load balancing (GLB) in terms of electricity cost, renewable energy integration and number of server switching. Our proposed strategies incorporate a new way of capturing the server switching cost. We show that, instead of modeling switching cost through a linear function, the proposed technique of modeling switching cost through variance achieves a better tradeoff between some important parameters. Since the three major input parameters-electricity price, renewable energy and number of job requests-vary over time, the average cost of electricity per job request may also exhibit dramatic fluctuations. We propose to tackle this volatility by controlling the average cost of electricity per job request through leveraging contracts in the forward electricity market, and determine the optimal amount of electricity to be procured in the forward electricity market.

The focus of cloud computing is increased utilization and power savings through consolidation while MapReduce enables large scale data analysis. Hadoop, an open source implementation of MapReduce has gained popularity in the last few years. In this paper, we evaluate Hadoop performance in both the traditional model of collocated data and compute services as well as consider the impact of separating out the services. The separation of data and compute services provides more flexibility in environments where data locality might not have a considerable impact such as virtualized environments and clusters with advanced networks. In this paper, we also conduct an energy efficiency evaluation of Hadoop on physical and virtual clusters in different configurations. Our extensive evaluation shows that: (1) coexisting virtual machines on servers decrease the disk throughput; (2) performance on physical clusters is significantly better than on virtual clusters; (3) performance degradation due to separation of the services depends on the data to compute ratio; (4) application completion progress correlates with the power consumption and power consumption is heavily application specific. Finally, we present a discussion on the implications of using cloud environments for big data analyses.},

	abstract = {Task consolidation is a way to maximize utilization of cloud computing resources. Maximizing resource utilization provides various benefits such as the rationalization of maintenance, IT service customization, QoS and reliable services, etc. However, maximizing resource utilization does not mean efficient energy use. Much of the literature shows that energy consumption and resource utilization in clouds are highly coupled. Consequently, some of the literature aims to decrease resource utilization in order to save energy, while others try to reach a balance between resource utilization and energy consumption. In this paper, we present an energy-aware task consolidation (ETC) technique that minimizes energy consumption. ETC achieves this by restricting CPU use below a specified peak threshold. ETC does this by consolidating tasks amongst virtual clusters. In addition, the energy cost model considers network latency when a task migrates to another virtual cluster. To evaluate the performance of ETC we compare it against MaxUtil. MaxUtil is a recently developed greedy algorithm that aims to maximize cloud computing resources. The simulation results show that ETC can significantly reduce power consumption in a cloud system, with 17% improvement over MaxUtil.},

This has led to increased failure occurrence within computing systems that induce substantial negative impact upon system performance and task reliability perceived by users. Such systems also consume vast quantities of power, resulting in significant operational costs perceived by providers. Virtualization -- a commonly deployed technology within Cloud datacenters -- can enable flexible scheduling of virtual machines to maximize system reliability and energy-efficiency. However, existing work address these two objectives separately, providing limited understanding towards studying the explicit trade-offs towards dependable and energy-efficient compute infrastructure. In this paper, we propose two failure-aware energy-efficient scheduling algorithms that exploit the holistic operational characteristics of the Cloud datacenter comprising the cooling unit, computing infrastructure and server failures. By comprehensively modeling the power and failure profiles of a Cloud datacenter, we propose workload scheduling algorithms Ella-W and Ella-B, capable of reducing cooling and compute energy while minimizing the impact of system failures. A novel and overall metric is proposed that combines energy efficiency and reliability to specify the performance of various algorithms. We evaluate our algorithms against Random, MaxUtil, TASA, MTTE and OBFIT under various system conditions of failure prediction accuracy and workload intensity. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ella-W can reduce energy usage by 29.5% and improve task completion rate by 3.6%, while Ella-B reduces energy usage by 32.7% with no degradation to task completion rate.},

	abstract = {High energy consumption in large-scale cloud data centers has become a burning issue, and efficient task and resource scheduling is an attractive way to cut down their energy consumption while providing satisfactory services for the customers. Unfortunately, existing scheduling approaches do not fully exploit the heterogeneity of real-tasks and physical hosts for maximum energy savings, while guaranteeing the timing requirements of real-time tasks. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we firstly develop a novel scheduling architecture that transforms the dynamic scheduling problem into multiple static schedules. Then, we propose an energy-efficient reactive scheduling algorithm, namely ERECT, to schedule the real-time tasks and computing resources in virtualized clouds. The proposed algorithm ERECT fully consider the heterogeneity of the real-time tasks and the hosts. In addition, when adding and deleting the virtual machines (VMs), the optimal operating frequencies and energy efficiencies of heterogeneous hosts are exploited to achieve energy conservation. Finally, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, extensive experiments are conducted to compare ERECT with two baseline scheduling algorithms in the context of Google traces. The experimental results show that ERECT outperforms those two existing algorithms in terms of guaranteeing tasks' deadlines (up to 14.06%) and energy saving (up to 9.81%).},

	abstract = {The high energy consumption of data centers has been a recurring issue in recent research. In cloud environments, several techniques are being used that aim for energy efficiency, ranging from scaling the processors frequency, to the use of sleep states during idle periods and the consolidation of virtual machines. Although these techniques enable a reduction in power consumption, they usually impact application performance. In this paper, we present an orchestration of different energy-savings techniques in order to improve the trade-off between energy consumption and application performance. To this end, we implemented the Energy-Efficient Cloud Orchestrator - e-eco - a management system that acts along with the cloud load balancer deciding which technique to apply during execution. To evaluate e-eco, tests were carried out in a real environment using scale-out applications on a dynamic cloud infrastructure, taking into account transactions per second as a performance metric. In addition to the empirical experiments, we also analyzed the scalability of our approach with an enhanced version of the CloudSim simulator. Results of our evaluations demonstrated that e-eco is able to reduce energy consumption up to 25% compared to power-agnostic approaches at a cost of only 6% of extra SLA violations. When compared to existing power-aware approaches, e-eco achieved the best trade-off between performance and energy-savings. These results showed that our orchestration approach showed a better balance in regard to a more energy-efficient data center with smaller impact on application performance when compared with other works presented in the literature.},

Transferring big data volume among the aforementioned parties requires a high bandwidth connection, which consumes larger amounts of energy than just processing and storing big data on cloud data centres, and hence producing high carbon dioxide emissions. This power consumption is highly significant when transferring big data into a data centre located relatively far from the users geographical location. Thus, it became high-necessity to locate the lowest energy consumption route between the user and the designated data centre, while making sure the users requirements, e.g. response time, are met. The main contribution of this paper is GreeDi, a network-based routing algorithm to find the most energy efficient path to the cloud data centre for processing and storing big data. The algorithm is, first, formalised by the situation calculus. The linear, goal and dynamic programming approaches are used to model the algorithm.

	abstract = {The pervasive adoption of cloud computing services and applications at a rapid rate makes the underlying data centers exacerbate the problems like carbon footprint and the operational cost, caused by the energy consumption. Various hardware-centric and software-centric approaches are proposed in the literature to reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data centers. Task scheduling algorithms are software-centric approaches to reduce the energy consumption in cloud computing systems. The majority of these algorithms focus on server consolidation leading to idle servers that reduce energy efficiency optimization. In this paper, we propose an Energy-Aware Task Scheduling algorithm on cloud Virtual Machines (EATSVM) that assigns a task to the VM where the increase in energy consumption is the least, considering both active and idle VMs. The algorithm also takes into consideration the increase in the energy consumption of the already running tasks on the VM due to increase in their execution time, while assigning a new task to that VM. We analyze the performance of our algorithm in a heterogeneous cloud environment with increasing number of tasks and compare the energy-savings of our algorithm with that of Energy Conscious Task Consolidation (ECTC) algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that EATSVM achieves energy-saving in a heterogeneous cloud-computing environment.},

Energy-efficient task scheduling is a feasible mode to attain these objectives. Nevertheless, it is difficult to match cloud resources to user requests in a way that improves performance while meeting a user-defined deadline for energy consumption reduction. Therefore, hybrid Pelican and Archimedes optimization algorithm fostered energy-aware task scheduling in heterogeneous virtualized cloud computing (TS-HVCC-Hyb-POA-AOA) is proposed in this article. A hybrid Pelican and Archimedes optimization algorithm (Hyb-POA-AOA) is used to lessen the task duration and the consumption of power in the cloud. For evaluation, the cloud environment uses the provided environment hybrid Pelican and Archimedes optimization algorithm for execute a few common workloads at the simulated data center. The performance metrics, like makespan right skewed analysis, makespan left skewed analysis, energy consumption right skewed analysis, energy consumption left skewed analysis, availability and resource utilization is considered. The performance of the proposed TS-HVCC-Hyb-POA-AOA method provides 23.69\%, 29.50\%, and 36.78\% higher resource utilization; 38.23\%, 31.35\%, and 26.19\% lower consumption of energy left skewed analysis and 34.52\%, 30.28\%, and 23.54\% lower makespan for right skewed analysis compared with existing methods such as; task scheduling in heterogeneous cloud environment with gray wolf optimization algorithm (TS-HVCC-GWOA), hybrid whale optimization approach and differential evolution optimization for multiple objective virtual machine programming at cloud services (TS-HVCC-WOA), energy and performance planning in TasterkHeterek virtualized cloud computing using particle swarm optimization algorithm (TS-HVCC-PSOA).},

	abstract = {Summary Autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, heterogeneous systems, and new high-performance embedded computing (HPEC) applications can benefit from the reuse of code coming from the high-performance computing world. However, unlike for HPC, energy efficiency is critical in embedded systems, especially when running on battery power. Code base from HPC mostly relies on the message passing interface (MPI) message passing runtime to deal with distributed systems. MPI has been designed primarily for performance and not for energy efficiency. One drawback is the way messages are received, in an energy-consuming busy-wait fashion. In this work, we study a simple approach in which receiving processes are put to sleep instead of constantly polling. We implement this strategy at the user level to be transparent to the MPI runtime and the application. Experiments are conducted with OpenMPI, MPICH, and MPC, using a video processing application and a software-distributed shared memory system deployed over two heterogeneous platforms, including the Christmann RECS|Box Antares Microserver. Results show significant energy savings. In some particular cases involving process colocation, we also observe better performance using our strategy which can be explained by a better sharing of the computing resource.},

The massive use of new heterogeneous mobile devices and technologies for discovering and deploying cloud services has led a trade-off between costs and improved quality of services (eg, fast response time, low cost, improved security, the reduction of energy consumption, and considerable emissions of carbon). This trade-off has led most cloud service providers to call for new intelligent, faster, and energy-saving solutions. This paper aims to propose a new approach based on Semantic Web technologies and Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, which intends to reduce the energy consumption of a wide variety of cloud services. Our approach is generic and, therefore, offers to customers a flexible infrastructure where they can easily perform their preferences.

	abstract = {Summary The massive growth of cloud computing has led to huge amounts of energy consumption and carbon emissions by a large number of servers. One of the major aspects of cloud computing is its scheduling of many task requests submitted by users. Minimizing energy consumption while ensuring the user's QoS preferences is very important to achieving profit maximization for the cloud service providers and ensuring the user's service level agreement (SLA). Therefore, in addition to implementing user's tasks, cloud data centers should meet the different criteria in applying the cloud resources by considering the multiple requirements of different users. Mapping of user requests to cloud resources for processing in a distributed environment is a well-known NP-hard problem. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes an energy-efficient task-scheduling algorithm based on best-worst (BWM) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methodology. The main objective of this paper is to determine which cloud scheduling solution is more important to select. First, a decision-making group identify the evaluation criteria. After that, a BWM process is applied to assign the importance weights for each criterion, because the selected criteria have varied importance. Then, TOPSIS uses these weighted criteria as inputs to evaluate and measure the performance of each alternative. The performance of the proposed and existing algorithms is evaluated using several benchmarks in the CloudSim toolkit and statistical testing through ANOVA, where the evaluation metrics include the makespan, energy consumption, and resource utilization.},

Due to the diverse geographic and economic situations, ICT network and service expansions throughout Nepal have been becoming quite challenging.

Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) collects 2\% royalty form Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Telecom Operators as Rural Telecommunications Disbursement Fund (RTDF) to enhance ICT services to rural Nepal.

This paper not only presents the current ICT deployment scenario of Nepal but also studies design, analysis, and evaluation of green networking that leverages both software defined networking (SDN), and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)---aka Software Defined IPv6 (SoDIP6)---for energy efficient networking, robust services, and sustainable ICT ecosystem for developing nations like Nepal. We evaluate the SoDIP6 network by considering a typical ISP with end access networks and present benefits and recommendations. Experimental results show that the proposed SoDIP6 network help significantly reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint leading to overall economic benefits to service providers and the society. Furthermore, energy-saving practices through SoDIP6 networks and some policy directions to the government to focus on green networking considering sensitivity of climate change and global warming impact in the mountainous and developing countries like Nepal are presented.},

	abstract = {Summary To answer the question `How much energy is consumed for a numerical simulation running on Graphic Processing Unit?', an experimental protocol is here established. The current provided to a graphic processing unit (GPU) during computation is directly measured using amperometric clamps. Signal processing on the intensity of the current of the power supplied to a GPU, with noise reduction technique, gives precise timing of GPU states, which allow establishing an energy consumption model of the GPU. Energy consumption of each operation, memory copy, vector addition, and element wise product is precisely measured to tune and validate the energy consumption model. The accuracy of the proposed energy consumption model compared to measurements is finally illustrated on a conjugate gradient method for a problem discretized by a finite element method.

	abstract = {SummaryCloud computing is a form of distributed computing, which promises to deliver reliable services through next-generation data centers that are built on virtualized compute and storage technologies. It is becoming truly ubiquitous and with cloud infrastructures becoming essential components for providing Internet services, there is an increase in energy-hungry data centers deployed by cloud providers. As cloud providers often rely on large data centers to offer the resources required by the users, the energy consumed by cloud infrastructures has become a key environmental and economical concern. Much energy is wasted in these data centers because of under-utilized resources hence contributing to global warming. To conserve energy, these under-utilized resources need to be efficiently utilized and to achieve this, jobs need to be allocated to the cloud resources in such a way so that the resources are used efficiently and there is a gain in performance and energy efficiency. In this paper, a model for energy-aware resource utilization technique has been proposed to efficiently manage cloud resources and enhance their utilization. It further helps in reducing the energy consumption of clouds by using server consolidation through virtualization without degrading the performance of users' applications. An artificial bee colony based energy-aware resource utilization technique corresponding to the model has been designed to allocate jobs to the resources in a cloud environment. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated with the existing algorithms through the CloudSim toolkit. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the existing techniques by minimizing energy consumption and execution time of applications submitted to the cloud.

This is done by energy efficiency improvement and renewable energy sources exploitation at large scales in the form of centralized systems as well as small-scale systems in the form of microgrids and nanogrids. However, smart grid technology brings new challenges to the big data management of the new power system construction. Additionally, due to the large-scale intermittent distributed renewable resources contribution and stochastic electric vehicles integration, the current energy management systems must undergo some improvements to handle the smart grid requirements. Cloud computing, as an intermittent based on-demand computing model, serves an emerging solution to the aforementioned challenges. As a result, this paper presents a survey study on the smart grid and state of art energy management methods and the necessitation of the cloud computing incorporation in smart grid energy management. Then, the application of the cloud computing in energy management, demand side management programs, building energy management systems, energy hubs, and power dispatching systems have been discussed and associated models are addressed.},

Big data centers that deliver cloud computing services contain thousands of computational nodes that consume a significant amount of energy. By introducing the virtual machine (VM), virtualization technology is trying to overcome this problem. One impressive technique for minimizing the total number of active physical servers that lead to improved energy consumption is VM consolidation. To optimize the consolidation process, effective VM placement can be used. In this paper, we first present a mathematical model aimed at reducing power consumption and costs by employing an effective VM consolidation in the cloud data center. Subsequently, we propose a genetic algorithm--based meta-heuristic algorithm, namely, energy and cost-aware VM consolidation for resolving the problem. Finally, we compare our proposed model with the well-known first fit, first fit decreasing, and permutation pack algorithms. The experimental results show that our proposed model reduced power consumption and costs when compared with the three demonstrated algorithms.},

The proportion of electricity used by infrastructures is 1.1\% to 1.5\% of the entire electricity production. It can expand even further. We also discern recent cloud computing advances in terms of the energy efficiency of the networks. In the literature and expertise covering servers, networks, cloud management platforms, and computers, including end-user apps, we discuss government-of-the-art strategies.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The two most significant differentiators among contemporary cloud computing service providers have increased green energy use and data center resource utilization. This paper addresses these two issues from a system's architectural optimization viewpoint. The proposed approach herein allows multiple cloud providers to utilize their individual computing resources in three ways by: (1) cutting the number of datacenters needed, (2) scheduling available datacenter grid energy via aggregators to reduce costs and power outages, and lastly by (3) utilizing, where appropriate, more renewable, and carbon-free energy sources. Altogether our proposed approach creates an alternative paradigm for a federated cloud system-of-systems (SoS) approach. The proposed paradigm employs a novel control methodology that is tuned to obtain both financial and environmental advantages. It also supports dynamic expansion and contraction of computing capabilities for handling sudden variations in service demand as well as for maximizing usage of time-varying green energy supplies. Herein we analyze the core SoS requirements, concept synthesis, and functional architecture with an eye on avoiding inadvertent cascading conditions. We suggest a physical architecture that diminishes unwanted outcomes while encouraging desirable results. Finally, in our approach, the constituent cloud services retain their independent ownership, objectives, funding, and sustainability means.},

Specifically, resources with a low utilization rate still consume an unacceptable amount of energy compared to the energy consumption of a fully utilized or sufficiently loaded Cloud computing. To increase resource utilization, task consolidation is an effective technique, greatly enabled by virtualization technologies, which facilitate the concurrent execution of several tasks and, in turn, reduce energy consumption. The authors use two energy-conscious heuristics for task consolidation: MaxUtil, which aims to maximize resource utilization, and Energy-Conscious Task Consolidation (ECTC) which explicitly takes into account both active and idle energy consumption. ECTC computes the energy consumption based on an objective function derived from findings reported in the literature. The chapter deals with the Cloud computing, energy models, and task consolidation algorithms. It describes the complementarity approach and the related mathematical model. The chapter finally summarizes the simulation results and discussions.},

	abstract = {Summary Our paper considers the following fundamental scheduling problem. There are n deterministic jobs to be scheduled offline on multiple identical machines, which have bounded capacities. Each job is associated with a start-time, an end-time, a process time, and demand for machine capacity. The goal is to schedule all of the jobs non-preemptively in their start-time-end-time windows, subject to machine capacity constraints such that the total busy time of the machines is minimized. We refer to this problem as minimizing the total busy time for the scheduling of multiple identical machines (MinTBT). This problem has important applications in power-aware scheduling for Cloud computing, optical network design, customer service systems, and other related areas. Scheduling to minimize busy times is already NP-hard in the special case where all jobs have the same process time and can be scheduled in a fixed time interval. One best-known result for this problem is a 5-approximation algorithm for special instances using first-fit-decreasing algorithm. In this paper, we propose and prove a 3-approximation algorithm, modified first-fit-decreasing-earliest for the general case and obtain more results for special cases. We then show how our results are applied in cloud computing to improve the energy efficiency. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Under considering CPU and memory factors, the key three steps for EEOM algorithm, including trigger time, VM selection, and host location, are optimized. EEOM algorithm takes use of the virtualization technology and migrates some VMs on the lightly loaded host and heavily loaded host to other hosts. The idle hosts are switched to low-power mode or shut down so as to save energy consumption. The experimental results show that, as compared with Double Threshold (DT) algorithm, the EEOM algorithm saves 7\% energy consumption and reduces 13\% SLA violations.},

	abstract = {Summary This chapter identifies three scenarios that current energy-aware cloud solutions cannot handle as isolated IaaS, but their federative efforts offer opportunities to be explored. These scenarios include multidata-center cloud operator, commercial cloud federations and academic cloud federations. Based on these scenarios, energy-aware scheduling policies to be applied in the management solutions of cloud federations are identified. The authors applied these approaches in an federated cloud management (FCM) architecture, which provides a unified interface over multiple cloud providers. A new scheduling policy that minimizes the overall energy consumption of a federation while maintaining its performance, is also discussed. New heuristics for energy-aware virtual machine (VM) management are also discussed. The chapter investigates how service integrations among different providers can be performed with the application of these strategies, in order to enable enhanced reliability, scalability, and utilization to broaden the market for smaller providers.},

	abstract = {Summary Nowadays, image and video processing applications have become widely used in many domains related to computer vision. Indeed, they can come from cameras, smartphones, social networks, or from medical devices. Generally, these images and videos are used for illustrating people or objects (cars, trains, planes, etc) in many situations such as airports, train stations, public areas, sport events, and hospitals. Thus, image and video processing algorithms have got increasing importance, they are required from various computer vision applications such as motion tracking, real time event detection, database (images and videos) indexation, and medical computer-aided diagnosis methods. The main inconvenient of image and video processing applications is the high intensity of computation and the complex configuration and installation of the related materials and libraries. In this paper, we propose a new framework that allows users to select in a smart and efficient way the computing units (CPU or/and GPU) in a cloud-based platform, in case of processing one image (or one video in real time) or many images (or videos). This framework enables to affect the local or remote computing units for calculation after analyzing the type of media and the algorithm complexity. The framework disposes of a set of selected CPU and GPU-based computer vision methods, such as image denoising, histogram computation, features descriptors (SIFT, SURF), points of interest extraction, edges detection, silhouette extraction, and sparse and dense optical flow estimation. These primitive functions are exploited in various applications such as medical image segmentation, videos indexation, real time motion analysis, and left ventricle segmentation and tracking from 2D echocardiography. Experimental results showed a global speedup ranging from 5× to 273×(compared to CPU versions) as result of the application of our framework for the above-mentioned methods. In addition to these performances, the parallel and heterogeneous implementations offered lower power consumption as result of the fast treatment.},

Although new processors feature sensors that enable precise power measurements, they provide different interfaces to collect data, making it difficult to correlate performance with energy consumption. To overcome this issue, the authors developed a platform-independent tool that collects power and energy data from homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Using this tool, they provide a detailed comparison between a low-power processor (ARM big.LITTLE) and a high performance processor (Intel Sandy Bridge-EP) using all applications from the NAS parallel benchmarks and a real-world soil irrigation simulator. The results show that the average power demand of Intel Sandy Bridge-EP is within 12.6× to 152.4× higher than ARM big.LITTLE, whereas its average energy consumption is within 1.6× to 7.1× superior. Overall, ARM big.LITTLE presented a better performance/energy trade-off when it takes <9.2× the execution time of Intel Sandy Bridge-EP to solve the same problem.},

Agile methods guarantee to accelerate the delivery of remarkable software with increased user satisfaction and reduced cost. However, in recent years, due to emergence of green software engineering, software developers are compelled to focus more on green and sustainable aspects of software. Global software engineering aims to design, develop, and use a software with limited energy and computing resources. Recently, software engineers in global software development (GSD) have adapted agile methods for quick, interactive, and environment-friendly software development. However, there is a lack of specific practices to be followed by GSD vendors in the development of green and sustainable software. In this study, we have identified 36 agile practices through systematic literature review and applied contrived search criteria derived from the research questions; 53 relevant papers were identified and reviewed. Findings of the systematic literature review were then empirically validated through questionnaire survey in GSD industry, in which 106 relevant experts from 25 different countries participated. The identified agile practices are intended to assist GSD vendors in strengthening their agile maturity towards green and sustainable software development.},

It addresses issues related to scheduling, load balancing, data replication, virtual machine placement, and networking that can be capitalized on to reduce the energy consumption in data centers. Enabling the sleep mode in idle computing servers and network hardware is the most efficient method of avoiding unnecessary power consumption. Consequently, load balancing becomes the key enabler for saving energy. Energy consumption virtualized data centers can be reduced by an appropriate decision on which physical server a virtual machine should be placed. Costs and operating expenses have become a growing concern in the cloud computing industry, with energy consumption accounting for a large percentage of the operational expenses in the data centers used as backend computing infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Summary Based on a pay-as-you-go model, cloud computing provides the possibility of hosting pervasive applications from both academic and business domains. However, data centers hosting cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and large carbon footprints to the environment. Energy-aware resource provisioning is an effective solution to diminish the energy consumption of cloud data centers. Recently, a growing trend has emerged, where cloud technology is used to run periodic real-time applications such as multimedia, telecommunication, video gaming, and industrial applications. In order for a real-time application to be able to use cloud services, cloud providers have to be able to provide timing guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an energy-aware resource provisioning mechanism for cloud data centers, which are capable of serving real-time periodic tasks following the Software as a Service model. The proposed method is compared against an energy-aware version of the RT-OpenStack. RT-OpenStack is a recently proposed approach to provide a time-predictable version of OpenStack. The experimental results manifest that our proposed resource provisioning method outperforms energy-aware version of the RT-OpenStack by 16.01\%, 25.45\%, and 25.45\% in terms of energy consumption, number of used servers, and average utilization of used servers, respectively. Moreover, from the scalability perspective, the preference of the proposed method for large-scale data centers is more considerable.},

	abstract = {Abstract Green and sustainable software development has emerged in recent years, and vendors are constantly striving to develop software that has a less hazardous impact on the environment, economy, and human beings. However, developing green software in the context of software multisourcing is not a risk-free activity, and vendors are exposed to several challenges. The authors have conducted both a systematic literature review and an industrial survey to identify the challenges faced by multisourcing vendors in the development of green and sustainable software. The final publication sample for the systematic literature review is composed of 54 research papers. Similarly, the final sample of the industrial survey is composed of 108 relevant experts. The authors have identified a list of 14 challenges. Of these challenges/risk factors, 8 have been tagged as critical risk factors. These critical risk factors are ``lack of green RE practices,'' ``high power consumption,'' ``high carbon emission throughout the software development,'' ``poor software design (architectural, logical, physical, and user interface),'' ``lack of ICTs for coordination and communication,'' ``high resource requirements,'' ``lack of coding standards,'' and ``lack of green software development knowledge.''},

	abstract = {Summary Nowadays, high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure can consume several megawatts. This chapter provides a state-of-the-art overview as regards energy efficiency in high-performance computing (HPC) facilities while describing the open challenges the research community has to face in the coming years to enable the building and usage of an exascale platform by 2020. It presents an overview of HPC systems. The chapter describes some research challenges and issues, while energy efficiency in clouds for HPC workload is discussed. The chapter also presents some examples of technological and economical barriers that have to be overcome before building an exascale system. The resource and job management system (RJMS) has a strategic position in the whole HPC software stack as it has a constant knowledge of both workload and resources. Virtualization is emerging as the prominent approach to mutualize the energy consumed by a single server running multiple virtual machines (VMs) instances.},

	abstract = {Summary Green IT is new way of developing, implementing, and managing computer resources with minimal impact to the environment. Many companies are investing in green technology and practices with the expectation of potentially saving money and making the company more efficient and competitive, besides saving the planet. But like any development, a comprehensive life cycle is required for success. The elements of a life cycle for green IT initiatives are presented in this chapter, starting with strategic planning with an enterprise architecture, moving to the implementation discussing return on investment, metrics and risk management, information assurance, then concluding with a discussion on communication and the impact of social media. A case study demonstrates aspects of the life cycle for a green IT project.},
