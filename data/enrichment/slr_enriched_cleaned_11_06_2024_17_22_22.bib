	abstract = {In organizations, part of sustainability is manifested through green information technology (GIT) for the use of information technologies (IT) resources in a profitable and sustainable manner. The purpose of this study was to understand the social, individual, and contextual factors that drive actors belonging to the sector of organizations in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) context on the intention to adopt GIT to generate strategies that promote its application. A model resulting from the analysis and integration of adoption models was proposed, including the theory of planned behavior (TPB), norm activation theory (NAT), GIT adoption model (GITAM), and environmental sustainability variables. To determine the predictive factors, the research team collected data from organizations belonging to Mexico, Panama, Honduras, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, where information was collected from personnel at strategic, tactical, and operational levels. Data were collected from 562 informants from different productive and service sectors and analyzed using a structural equation model with the partial least squares technique. This research provided important insights into the most significant factors that determine intent towards GIT adoption. The model analyzed contextual variables of the organization or external drivers, such as the motivating forces of environmental sustainability and environmental, organizational, and technological contexts; and behavioral variables of internal organizational actors, such as awareness of the consequences, attribution of responsibility, motivation, attitude, assignment of responsibility, and internal IT enablers.},

	abstract = {Software is a central component in the modern world and vastly affects the environment's sustainability. The demand for energy and resource requirements is rising when producing hardware and software units. Literature study reveals that many studies focused on green hardware; however, limited efforts were made in the greenness of software products. Green software products are necessary to solve the issues and problems related to the long-term use of software, especially from a sustainability perspective. Without a proper mechanism for measuring the greenness of a particular software product executed in a specific environment, the mentioned benefits will not be attained. Currently, there are not enough works to address this problem, and the green status of software products is uncertain and unsure. This paper aims to identify the green measurements based on sustainable dimensions in a software product. The second objective is to reveal the relationships between the elements and measurements through empirical study. The study is conducted in two phases. The first phase is the theoretical phase, where the main components, measurements and practices that influence the sustainability of a software product are identified. The second phase is the empirical study that involved 103 respondents in Malaysia investigating current practices of green software in the industrial environment and further identifying the main sustainability dimensions and measurements and their impact on achieving green software products. This study has revealed seven green measurements of software product: Productivity, Usability, Cost Reduction, Employee Support, Energy Efficiency, Resource Efficiency and Tool Support. The relationships are statistically significant, with a significance level of less than 0.01 (p = 0.000). Thus, the hypothesised relationships were all accepted. The contributions of this study revolve around the research perspectives of the measurements to attain a green software product.},

	abstract = {Distributed heterogeneous systems have been widely adopted in industrial applications by providing high scalability and performance while keeping complexity and energy consumption under control. However, along with the increase in the number of computing nodes, the energy consumption of distributed heterogeneous systems dramatically grows and is extremely hard to predict. Energy-conscious task scheduling, which tries to assign appropriate priorities and processors to tasks such that the system energy requirement would be met, has received extensive attention in recent years. However, many approaches reduce energy consumption by extending the completion time. In this article, we focus on the scheduling problem of energy-conscious tasks in distributed heterogeneous computing systems and provide an efficient approach to mitigate energy consumption while minimizing the overall makespan of parallel applications. First, based on the heterogeneous earliest finish time, a fitness function is proposed to balance the makespan and energy consumption. Then, by improving the crossover and mutation operations of the traditional genetic algorithm, we proposed an efficient scheduling approach named energy-conscious genetic algorithm to optimize the priorities and processor allocation of tasks, with objectives of minimizing the system energy and makespan. Experiment results on real-world applications and simulations with randomly generated task graphs demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms in energy-saving and makespan reducing.},

	abstract = {Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demands adequate levels of awareness and actions to address sustainability challenges. Software systems will play an important role in moving towards these targets. Sustainability skills are necessary to support the development of software systems and to provide sustainable IT-supported services for citizens. While there is a growing number of academic bodies, including sustainability education in engineering and computer science curricula, there is not yet comprehensive research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop such systems. This study aims to identify the industrial sustainability needs for education and training from software engineers' perspective. We conducted interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed to achieve their goals. Our findings show that organisations are interested in sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons. They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter difficulties, like the trade-off between short-term financial profitability and long-term sustainability goals. To fill the gaps, they have promoted in-house training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to external training. The acquired competencies make sustainability an integral part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking, soft skills, technical sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements, values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to identify the important barriers for developing a long-term Artificial Intelligence (AI) cloud system in an Information Technology (IT) business. A fuzzy integrated hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model was established and applied to achieve this goal. In this ongoing analysis, Delphi was used to filter the most crucial ones from a list of 18 identified parameters, whereas, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the relevance of each parameter. Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) were further applied to identify the cause-effect relationship and to construct the hierarchical interrelationships among the parameters. Finally, to identify the driving and dependence parameters, Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) approach was used. The findings revealed that the most crucial elements in building a sustainable AI cloud system were technological, financial, and environmental concerns. More particularly, from all perspectives, digitalization is deemed to be the most critical within the group, with the greatest priority degree and significant driving as well as dependent tendency. According to ISM and MICMAC, user tendency to learn and R&D sector collaboration seems to be the most dependent and the independent factors respectively among the group. Remaining of the 13 factors are interrelated and operates as linkage obstacles. This study provides useful insights for IT firms trying to implement sustainable AI cloud systems and underlines the importance of including environmental and economic concerns into decision-making processes.},

@article{MOGHADDAM2021142,
	abstract = {Cloud service providers use load balancing algorithms in order to avoid Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) and wasted energy consumption due to host over- and under-utilization, respectively. Load balancing algorithms migrate VMs between hosts in order to balance host loads. Any Virtual Machines (VMs) that are migrated experience performance degradation which results in lower Quality of Service (QoS) and can possibly result in SLAVs. Hence, an optimal load balancing method should reduce the number of over- and under-utilized hosts with a minimal number of VM migrations. One of the metrics used previously in the literature for evaluating load balancing stated that it equally considered SLAVs caused by both over-utilized hosts and migrations. However, in this paper, we show that, in fact, this metric values keeping the number of migrations low at the expense of an increased number of over-utilized hosts. This disparity is demonstrated by simulation of Google, PlanetLab and Azure data sets in CloudSim. This metric may suit public cloud providers which are focused on minimizing SLAVs and keeping energy costs low, but does not consider the QoS of customer VMs. We propose an alternative metric that considers QoS for the VMs. This alternative metric considers not only performance loss during migration, but also performance degradation due to host over-utilization. Private cloud providers, e.g., IT services within large organizations, often value the performance of their ``customer'' VMs, i.e., the QoS their organization receives, as well as traditional cloud provider costs, i.e., energy and SLAV costs. Hence, our alternative metric would be more appropriate in these scenarios. We compare and contrast load balancing methods using both the existing, biased metric and our new alternative metric.},

	abstract = {There is a quite intensive research for Cloud simulators in the recent years, mainly due to the fact that the need for powerful computational resources has led organizations to use cloud resources instead of acquiring and maintaining private servers. In order to test and optimize the strategies that are being used on cloud resources, cloud simulators have been developed since the simulation cost is substantially smaller than experimenting on real cloud environments. Several cloud simulation frameworks have been proposed during the last years, focusing on various components of the cloud resources. In this paper, a survey on cloud simulators is conducted, in order to examine the different models that have been used for the hardware components that constitute a cloud data center. Focus is given on the energy models that have been proposed for the prediction of the energy consumption of data center components, such as CPU, memory, storage and network, while experiments are performed in order to compare the different power models used by the simulation frameworks. The following cloud simulation frameworks are considered: CloudSched, CloudSim, DCSim, GDCSim, GreenCloud and iCanCloud.},

@article{QUARATI2016403,
	abstract = {The flexible and pay-as-you-go computing capabilities offered by Cloud infrastructures are nowadays very attractive, and widely adopted by many organizations and enterprises. In particular this is true for those having periodical or variable tasks to execute, and, choose to not or cannot afford the expenses of buying and managing computing facilities or software packages, that should remain underutilized for most of the time. For their ability to couple the scalability offered by public service providers, with the wider Quality of Service (QoS) provisions and ad-hoc customizations provided by private Clouds, Hybrid Clouds (HC) seem a particularly appealing solution for customers requiring something more than the mere availability of the service. The paper firstly introduces a Cloud brokering system leveraging on a promising architectural approach, based on the use of a gateway toolkit. This approach provides noticeably advantages, both to customers and to Cloud Brokers (CB), for its ability to hide all the intricacies related to the management of powerful, but often complex and heterogeneous infrastructures like the Cloud. Moreover such approach, through customized interfaces, facilitates customers in accessing Cloud resources thus easing the tailored deployment and execution of their applications and workflows. The major contribution of this work is given by the analysis of a set of brokering strategies for Hybrid Clouds, implemented by a brokering algorithm, aimed at the execution of various applications subject to different user requirements and computational conditions. With the objective of firstly maximize both user satisfaction and CB's revenues the algorithm also pursues profit increases through the reduction of energy costs by adopting energy saving mechanisms. A simulation model is used to evaluate performance, and the results show that differences among strategies depend on type and size of system loads and that the use of turn on and off techniques greatly improves energy savings at low and medium load rates thus indirectly increasing CB revenues without diminishing customers' satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Green cloud computing gains popularity over the last decade due to the extensive use of cloud computing. The trend towards cloud computing is spreading at a fast rate. Cloud computing providers extend their data centers at regular intervals. However, cloud providers face severe issues about sustaining the environment because big data centers are responsible for consuming a vast amount of energy and producing a carbon footprint. The solution to address such an issue is green cloud computing. In the literature, a considerable amount of research has been done to determine the challenges and practices in adopting green cloud computing. Still, the field is immature and needs further research to identify the challenges and practices faced and addressed by various stakeholders. This research focuses on identifying the challenges faced by client organizations in adopting the green cloud and the associated practices for addressing the challenges. The challenges and patterns were identified via a systematic literature review from the relevant literature. After thorough conduction of the systematic literature review (SLR), we have identified 9 challenges and 63 practices from 68 papers in the cloud domain. In the future, we plan to develop a comprehensive framework by using some robust soft computing techniques like Fuzzy logic or AHP, etc., to assist the clients in adopting the green cloud environment.},

	abstract = {With rapid development of cloud computing technologies and applications, the number and scale of cloud data centers have grown exponentially in recent years. One of the major problems with current cloud data centers is their huge energy consumption, which makes energy consumption management one of the hottest research topics in the field of cloud computing. This paper aims at implementing an effective Distributed Energy Meter (DEM) system for heterogeneous cloud environments based on a multi-component power consumption model for cloud servers. Specifically, we propose a modeling method for the energy consumption of key components (CPU, memory and disk) of computer servers and reveal the mathematical relationship between the resource usage of the key components and the system energy consumption. The proposed DEM system cannot only estimate the energy consumption of heterogeneous cluster environments (Linux and Windows NT), but also support various CPU power consumption models. In addition, a unique disk power consumption model that uses different thresholds to distinguish various disk I/O states (sequential/random, read/write) to achieve an accurate estimation of disk power consumption. Experimental studies conducted on a heterogeneous cluster with workloads generated by PCMark and Sysbench demonstrate that the proposed DEM system outperforms the state-of-art models in estimating the energy consumption of heterogeneous cloud environments.},

	abstract = {Due to the growth of the internet and internet-based software applications, cloud data center demand has increased. Cloud data centers have thousands of servers that are 24×7 working for users; it is the strong witness of enormous energy consumption for the operation of the cloud data center. However, server utilization is not remaining the same all the time, so, from an economic feasibility point of view, energy management is an essential activity for cloud resource management. Some well-known energy management techniques for cloud data centers generally used are dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), dynamic power management (DPM), and task scheduling-based techniques. The present work is based on an analytical approach to integrating resource provisioning with sophisticated task scheduling; the authors estimate energy utilization by cloud data centers using iDR cloud simulator. The work is intended to optimize power consumption in the cloud data center.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a suitable platform for workflows that work with massive data and big data. Through virtualization, cloud computing converts physical infrastructures to virtual machines (VMs). Virtual machines can meet fluctuating and dynamic requests through simpler management. Workflow scheduling in cloud computing is important, concerning the fact that proper scheduling can enhance the efficiency of the cloud and good scheduling can cause energy consumption reduction. As energy efficiency is one of the most important issues in cloud computing, in this paper a new statistical analysis-based algorithm is suggested for defining similarities of input workflows. The proposed algorithm, which is called massive data similarity statistics analysis algorithm (MSSA), classifies virtual machines into virtual clusters and it executes scheduling by reforming the virtual clusters. Furthermore, MSSA investigates the similarities of message passing in two different periods; it decides for the next period, and finally, carries out the load balancing by a new method for transferring the machines in virtual clusters. The results of simulation with CloudSim show that the proposed algorithm is more energy efficient in comparison with traditional methods, like FIFO, and heuristic methods such as BlindPick, and relatively new method, named eOO as well as makespan. The main parameter for comparing is makespan and energy consumption. The results showed that the proposed method is more energy efficient compared with similar algorithms and it reduced the makespan significantly.},

However, research on the adoption of GIT practices has mostly addressed organizational factors and outcomes, with limited emphasis on the cognitive and attitudinal factors associated with behavioral change. Based on the Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework, this research examined the effects of individual, social and organizational factors on GIT attitude among a sample of IT professionals in ISO 14001 certified IT companies in Malaysia and investigated the mediating effects of their beliefs about GIT. Further, this research investigated the relationship between GIT attitudes and behavioral change, as indicated through self-reported engagement in green computing practices. Survey methods were used to collect data from 333 respondents. The results support the direct effects of GIT knowledge, social influence and green management culture on GIT attitude. However, hypothesized indirect effects through the mediation of GIT beliefs were supported for GIT knowledge and social influence, but not for green management culture. The relationship between GIT attitude and engagement in green computing practices was supported. The implications of these results are discussed, and future research directions are suggested.},

Information technology (IT) is a significant end user of energy, consuming over 10% of commercial electricity [2]. 0.37GtCO2e of IT GHG emissions are attributed to end user computing (EUC) devices, such as desktop computers and notebooks [3]. The United Nations (UN) indicates combining existing technology innovative and behavioural changes has the potential to transform societies and reduce GHG emissions [4]. As the commercial and public sector transitions from desktops to notebooks [5], accurately identifying energy efficient mobile devices offers the ability to support this concept by reducing concomitant GHG emissions. However, accurately measuring device use phase energy (UPE) generated GHG emissions is elusive. Organisations currently avoid the direct measurement due to scale, complexity and logistical issues that cause the practice to become costly and therefore impractical [6]. As an alternative, EUC energy consumption is estimated based on typical electricity consumption (TEC) benchmark data, extrapolated by the number of users and then converted to GHG equivalent units. Conducting a field experiment measuring EUC energy consumption in a business environment, this research substantiates that accepted estimation methods introduce an error range between -48% to +107%. Consequently, the error causes EUC GHG scope 2 accounting to be underestimated by 30% and abatement opportunities of up to 55% to be overlooked.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) systems offer on demand virtual infrastructures so reliably and flexibly that users expect a high service level. Therefore, even with regards to internal IaaS behaviour, production clouds only adopt novel ideas that are proven not to hinder established service levels. To analyse their expected behaviour, new ideas are often evaluated with simulators in production IaaS system-like scenarios. For instance, new research could enable collaboration amongst several layers of schedulers or could consider new optimisation objectives such as energy consumption. Unfortunately, current cloud simulators are hard to employ and they often have performance issues when several layers of schedulers interact in them. To target these issues, a new IaaS simulation framework (called DISSECT-CF) was designed. The new simulator's foundation has the following goals: easy extensibility, support energy evaluation of IaaSs and to enable fast evaluation of many scheduling and IaaS internal behaviour related scenarios. In response to the requirements of such scenarios, the new simulator introduces concepts such as: a unified model for resource sharing and a new energy metering framework with hierarchical and indirect metering options. Then, the comparison of several simulated situations to real-life IaaS behaviour is used to validate the simulator's functionality. Finally, a performance comparison is presented between DISSECT-CF and some currently available simulators.},

The definition of an optimal scheduling policy which does not negatively impact to system performance and task completion time is still challenging. In this work, we present a new simulation tool for cloud computing, GAME-SCORE, which implements a scheduling model based on the Stackelberg game. This game presents two main players: a) the scheduler and b) the energy-efficiency agent. We used the GAME-SCORE simulator to analyse the efficiency of the proposed game-based scheduling model.

The advantages of the hierarchical approach are twofold: first entities controlling parts of computing infrastructure may decide how much of their responsibility is delegated to the coordinator, next the computational complexity of related mathematical programming problems may be reduced, and their solution may be done in parallel. The mathematical programming problem of task allocation is defined in the centralized form first.

	abstract = {One of the significant limitations in the evaluation of hybrid clouds is the difficulty in validating new solutions by their deployment in real systems since replication of tests on large environments is usually highly expensive. To overcome these limitations, simulators have become popular for conducting preliminary tests. However, there is still a lack of simulation tools with easy-to-use code that allows handling diverse cloud scenarios and the simulation of energy consumption of all devices (hosts, switches, routers, and storage). To fill this gap, the simulator SinergyCloud has been developed to evaluate data centers in hybrid clouds. SinergyCloud allows evaluating diverse cloud scenarios, including energy consumption, workflow makespan, the completion time of tasks, and migrations of virtual machines, with a fine granularity of abstraction. SinergyCloud can handle the simulation of hybrid clouds with multiple data centers composed of hundreds of thousands of devices. Moreover, it is a Java-based, event-driven, and packet-level simulator, having a less steep learning curve than do other simulators. To show the feasibility of SinergyCloud, we performed accuracy and scalability analyses. Metrics values obtained by another simulator had less than 1% difference compared to SinergyCloud, demonstrating its accuracy. In terms of scalability, a scenario with 10,000 hosts was simulated in about 7 h using a typical personal computer. A comprehensive analysis of algorithms for the scheduling of virtual machines in a hybrid cloud is also presented, showing how to perform various evaluations.},

	abstract = {Cloud systems have become an essential part of our daily lives owing to various Internet-based services. Consequently, their energy utilization has also become a necessary concern in cloud computing systems increasingly. Live migration, including several virtual machines (VMs) packed on in minimal physical machines (PMs) as virtual machines consolidation (VMC) technique, is an approach to optimize power consumption. In this article, we have proposed an energy-aware method for the VMC problem, which is called energy-aware virtual machines consolidation (EVMC), to optimize the energy consumption regarding the quality of service guarantee, which comprises: (1) the support vector machine classification method based on the utilization rate of all resource of PMs that is used for PM detection in terms of the amount' load; (2) the modified minimization of migration approach which is used for VM selection; (3) the modified particle swarm optimization which is implemented for VM placement. Also, the evaluation of the functional requirements of the method is presented by the formal method and the non-functional requirements by simulation.

The aim of this study is to find out the level of awareness and the adoption of green computing in India. Descriptive research was undertaken on the basis of primary data, which were collected from 250 Indian respondents using a structured questionnaire. Results of the study show a low level of awareness about green computing among the respondents and a moderate level of effort by them for judicious use of electronic devices and their safe disposal/recycling. The paper offers fresh insights into the relatively slow pace of green computing practices in India and the new ways and means to accelerate them for creating a safer environment.},

	abstract = {Virtual Machine (VM) live migration is one of the strategic approaches that can be employed to reduce energy consumption and increase the utilisation of a large computing infrastructure. In this paper, we implement the pre-copy live migration algorithm to provide a test environment for live job migration in a high throughput computing system (HTC). We present details of our extension into the HTC-Sim simulation framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance and energy impact of our responsive live migration approach in high throughput computing (HTC) systems with various migration policies. The proposed policies focus on which computer to select for migration from an HTC resource pool. We evaluate our migration policies through the use of our HTC-Sim simulation framework. Moreover, we compare the results between the policies as well as the system where migration is not considered. We demonstrate that our responsive migration could save approximately 75% of the system wasted energy due to job evictions by user interruptions where migration is not employed as a fault-tolerance mechanism.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of a plethora of embedded and portable applications, energy dissipation has joined throughput, area, and accuracy/precision as a major design constraint. Thus, designers must be concerned with both optimizing and estimating the energy consumption of circuits, architectures, and software. Most of the research in energy optimization and/or estimation has focused on single components of the system and has not looked across the interacting spectrum of the hardware and software. The novelty of our new energy estimation framework, SimplePower, is that it evaluates the energy considering the system as a whole rather than just as a sum of parts, and that it concurrently supports both compiler and architectural experimentation.We present the design and use of the SimplePower framework that includes a transition-sensitive, cycle-accurate datapath energy model that interfaces with analytical and transition sensitive energy models for the memory and bus subsystems, respectively. We analyzed the energy consumption of ten codes from the multidimensional array domain, a domain that is important for embedded video and signal processing systems, after applying different compiler and architectural optimizations. Our experiments demonstrate that early estimates from the SimplePower energy estimation framework can help identify the system energy hotspots and enable architects and compiler designers to focus their efforts on these areas.},

Our proposed model includes an optimized resource allocation scheme for HPC jobs based on processor frequency and a Vickery-Clarke-Groove (VCG)-based forward auction model to enable energy reduction participation from HPC users. The model ensures truthful participation from HPC users, where users benefit from revealing their true valuation of energy reduction. We implement a job scheduler simulator and our mechanism model on a parallel discrete-event simulation engine. Through trace-based simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our auction mechanism model. Simulation shows that our model can achieve overall energy reduction for an HPC system, while ensuring truthful participation from the users.},

Visualizing the aforementioned information and bringing it together in one application can help organizations in understanding and adapting their energy consumption behavior in order to better support environmentally sustainable practices. The purpose of this project, from a power analytics standpoint, is twofold: (1) it aims to provide users with insight into their device's current power consumption without leaving a footprint on their machine, and (2) to analyze if one method gives more accurate results than others. We performed analysis using Microsoft Joulemeter and power estimation using software design methodologies (with numbers from smart meters as our benchmark).},

	abstract = {Massive data centers housing thousands of computing nodes have become commonplace in enterprise computing, and the power consumption of such data centers is growing at an unprecedented rate. Adding to the problem is the inability of the servers to exhibit energy proportionality, i.e., provide energy-efficient execution under all levels of utilization, which diminishes the overall energy efficiency of the data center. It is imperative that we realize effective strategies to control the power consumption of the server and improve the energy efficiency of data centers. With the advent of Intel Sandy Bridge processors, we have the ability to specify a limit on power consumption during runtime, which creates opportunities to design new power-management techniques for enterprise workloads and make the systems that they run on more energy proportional.In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to achieve energy proportionality for an enterprise-class server workload, namely SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark, by using Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interfaces. First, we analyze the power consumption and characterize the instantaneous power profile of the SPECpower benchmark within different subsystems using the on-chip energy meters exposed via the RAPL interfaces. We then analyze the impact of RAPL power limiting on the performance, per-transaction response time, power consumption, and energy efficiency of the benchmark under different load levels. Our observations and results shed light on the efficacy of the RAPL interfaces and provide guidance for designing power-management techniques for enterprise-class workloads.},

The study includes 143 participants, who completed an online survey and answered various questions on Green IT (e.g., on perceived knowledge, attitude, intention to adopt behaviours). The results of the study reveal that the more perceived knowledge of Green IT the participants had, the more positive their attitude towards Green IT and the greater their intention to adopt Green IT behaviours.

	abstract = {Given the widespread use of computer technologies and mounting concerns over its impact on climate change, energy consumption and environmental degradation, one would imagine that IT workers would be practicing and advocating green computing behaviors. Employing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study therefore set out to examine the influence of factors such as attitude, social influence, media influence, perceived behavioral control and environmental concern on the IT worker's green computing intention. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 149 respondents within a large financial services firm in Gauteng. Descriptive statistics suggest that personal awareness, knowledge and actual green computing behaviors are low. Regression analysis indicates that environmental concern, perceived behavioral control, attitude, and media influence are important predictors while social influence plays almost no role -- suggesting that IT workers are under no social pressure to practice green computing. The paper recommends that responsible peers, firms, higher education institutions, and media focus their attention on driving environmental awareness in order to promote green computing behaviors among seemingly unaware and disempowered IT workers.},

	abstract = {Sustainable computing is a rapidly growing research area spanning several areas of computer science. In the software engineering field, the topic has received increasing attention in recent years, with several studies addressing a range of concerns. However, few studies have demonstrated the awareness of software practitioners about the underlying concepts of sustainability in the software development practice. In this effect, in this study, we aim to provide some evidence about the practitioners' perception about the adoption of sustainability in software development, under four main perspectives: economic, social, environmental and technical. To accomplish such a goal, we carried out a survey study with twenty-five software engineers involved in projects in different domains. The yielded results indicate an overall lack of knowledge about the topic, in particular regarding the concepts about sustainable software, although it is a common understanding that sustainability should be treated as a quality attribute and should support the interaction between sustainability and the software development life cycle phases. Among the observed perspectives, the respondents indicate that the technical dimension is the most relevant and explored so far. This study contributes to the field with initial evidence and can be seen as a first step towards establishing a common understanding about how the software industry is receptive to the use of sustainability concepts in software development practices.},

However, in order to make the model useful, it is necessary to identify measures for each sub-characteristic and characteristic. For that reason, the objective of this paper is to carry out a Systematic Literature Review to discover the state-of-the art in software sustainability measures.},

We adopt a design science research methodology for developing and evaluating the maturity model. Our model is based on a review of existing Green IT maturity models and is thereafter iteratively developed and refined through a Delphi study. The evaluation of the Green IT model reveals that the model is applicable for identifying the organizational-level capabilities that contribute to Green IT adoption, and to enable organizations to assess their current state of Green IT adoption.},

Studies related to software sustainability propose models, frameworks, or practices that can be applied in the industry. But most of these proposals are still not systematically adopted in the industry. Therefore, there is an opportunity to create a structured meeting to support the concrete adoption of sustainability practices in software development. This paper aims to provide an overview of these frameworks and how they can help facilitate sustainability-driven meetings (SusDM). Seeking this, we present practical examples and a workflow to prepare the meeting by applying the existing sustainability frameworks in SusDM. As a position paper, our hypothesis is that the contributions of this meeting may be related to improving the knowledge of software developers on sustainable software engineering, discovering new sustainability requirements, prioritization, and implementing software sustainability practices.},

	abstract = {Digital services - applications that often span the entire computing continuum - have become an essential part of our daily lives, but they can have a significant energy cost, raising sustainability concerns. The computing continuum features multiple distributed layers (edge, fog, and cloud) with specific computing infrastructure and scheduling decisions at each layer, which impact the overall quality of service and energy consumption of digital services. Measuring the energy consumption of such applications is challenging due to the distributed nature of the system and the application. As such, simulation techniques are promising solutions to estimate energy consumption, and several simulators are available for modeling the cloud and fog computing environment.In this paper, we investigate iFogSim's effectiveness in analyzing the end-to-end energy consumption of applications in the computing continuum through two case studies. We design different scenarios for each case study to map application modules to devices along the continuum, including the Edge-Cloud collaboration architecture, and compare them with the two placement policies native to iFogSim: Cloud-only and Edge-ward policies. We observe iFogSim's limitations in reporting energy consumption, and improve its ability to report energy consumption from an application's perspective; this enables additional insight into an application's energy consumption, thus enhancing the usability of iFogSim in evaluating the end-to-end energy consumption of digital services.},

	abstract = {Introduction:Most of the capabilities of software and IT systems are defined during the development phase. This implies that after deployment only few run-time adjustments are possible. It is assumed that not all software engineers have sustainability aspects in mind during the software design and implementation phases. This can lead to design decisions and implementations with sustainability debts, comparable to technical debts. To avoid these debts, caused by omission and non-active addressing of sustainability criteria, the engineers need systematic knowledge or at least references of cause-effect relations about the sustainability impacts of their decisions.Objective: This work presents an approach to facilitate the needed sustainability awareness to software engineers and solution architects in large organizations, by presenting a cheat sheet for rapid decision making. The desired result is a potential shift left of sustainable software engineering.Methods: An Action Research (AR) approach was chosen, with design and evaluation iterations in different development stages and different projects. The design team of the sustainability awareness kit was formed by a diverse team of experts from quality management, software engineering, solution architecture and machine learning/data science.Results: Different metrics and proxy metrics were defined; key drivers of positive and negative sustainability performance were defined, and both integrated in a cheat sheet for awareness creation and facilitation of rapid decision making.Conclusion: Refinement of the cheat sheet is ongoing and currently under observation in different development teams. Intermediate results hint at the fostering of sustainability awareness and actual, tangible results in sustainability performances of IT projects.},

	abstract = {The pay-per-use model of cloud computing is booming in every industry. Power-hungry large heterogeneous data centers are providing these cloud services for 24× 7. Green cloud computing offers an energy-efficient and environment-friendly mechanism to offer cloud services while maintaining the quality of service (QoS). QoS is defined in terms of service-level agreement (SLA). VM Consolidation is one of the widely used frameworks that involve Virtual Machine (VM) migration and VM Placement to reduce energy consumption and maintain better QoS. Using the VM Placement policy VMs are allocated to suitable physical machines (PM). Efficient VM placement with better resource management can conserve electricity and provide better QoS. A new SLA and energy-aware VM placement policy have been developed in this research. The VMs are placed in a PM having the least energy consumption and SLA violation (SLAV). Further, the proposed VM placement policy has been implemented using CloudSim and it has been shown that the proposed VM placement policy outperforms state-of-art VM placement policies like PEBFD, MBFD, MFPED, and PEFED.},

The cost and operating expenses of data centers have skyrocketed with the increase in computing capacity. Several governmental, industrial, and academic surveys indicate that the energy utilized by computing and communication units within a data center contributes to a considerable slice of the data center operational costs. In this paper, we present a simulation environment for energy-aware cloud computing data centers. Along with the workload distribution, the simulator is designed to capture details of the energy consumed by data center components (servers, switches, and links) as well as packet-level communication patterns in realistic setups. The simulation results obtained for two-tier, three- tier, and three-tier high-speed data center architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the simulator in utilizing power management schema, such as voltage scaling, frequency scaling, and dynamic shutdown that are applied to the computing and networking components.},

	abstract = {Host virtualization has become of great interest as it is a technology that can enable the implementation of cloud computing. For this, it can offer several benefits, such as high levels of sharing of computing resources, ubiquitous availability, and savings on hardware investment. Although it has been claimed that host virtualization can also offer the benefit of energy savings, the levels of savings are unknown. In this paper, we present experimental evaluations of energy expenditure of virtual machines used for computation processes. We measure the energy spent by a number of virtual machines and compare it to the energy spent by a single and multiple (real) Linux hosts. The results show that the virtual machines deliver similar performance to processes run in real machines for small loads, and achieve significant energy savings for a modest number of users. Therefore, it is then expected that there is a number of VMs for what energy savings is optimal. The values also indicate that workstations optimized for virtualization can offer significant benefits.},

The main concern is efficient energy usage, which is influenced by elements, such as internet nodes, client-server network and nodes, also temperature sensing units and other devices. Most environmental impact is based on peripherals and resource utilization energy cost. To limit the energy impact and energy utilization we're attempting to lower the amount of energy consumed by both currently active and inactive cloud assets treated as DAG. This is being attempted by using the improved scheduling method which is an optimal energy-cutback strategy for scheduling based on energy aware in this environment to minimize network resources in cloud environment. In this paper in section 3 the strategy has been discussed along with algorithm and in section 4 the result analysis has been done. It is found that as per simulation two objectives one scheduling and other resources reduction is being meet here and helped in reduction of the energy consumption.},

The ICT sector itself consumes a lot of energy so there is a need to think of alternatives that can reduce the level of energy consumption, thus, green ICT practice can be a good option. There is, however, a scarcity of researches that explains how the maintenance of green knowledge in ICT software development may be implemented. Since we recognize that software development process (SDL) plays an essential role in enabling the ICT community, uncontrolled green knowledge in developing software that would lead to the dilemma of failing to satisfy both the community's business and environmental requirements. Therefore, this research will concentrate on presenting a methodology applying an innovative model for managing the green software development and implementation. Keeping this concern in mind the present paper is going to provide a Green and Sustainable software model which can be used in green ICT practices and will be helpful in reducing the energy consumption used by computers.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a model that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. Numerous studies have shown that by replacing traditional computing with cloud infrastructure, the total power consumption can be decreased because cloud computing power consumption is influenced by four key cloud factors: dynamic provisioning, multi-tenancy, server utilization, and data center efficiency. Considering the huge amount of energy consumed by computing equipment in the last several years, energy consumption and sustainability have become one of the main areas of research. Thus, obtaining high performance at a reduced cost in cloud environments has reached a turning point where computing power is no longer the most important concern. Calculate the amount of energy consumption in a real cloud computing infrastructure is difficult. Thus, simulation tools have been developed in recent years to enable cloud computing researchers to analyze a cloud computing environment. This paper will introduce and compare the two popular cloud simulators: Cloud Sim and Green Cloud. Both simulators provide scenarios for cloud computing based on utilization, virtualization, and load and energy consumption of the server. The comparison showed that the Green Cloud simulator is more advantageous than the Cloud Sim simulator based on an accurate measurement of energy consumption in a cloud computing environment.},

However, past publications mainly focused on electricity consumption in data centers, while there are other important sources of electricity consumption in computing. The concept of green computing should be also applied to these sources.

We model the different resources using colored tokens in a timed hierarchical Petri net and monitor the carbon footprint of the software as it goes through its lifecycle.

The fast changing global weather requires Information Technology (IT) practitioners in university institutions to respond to these changes and implement Green strategies and initiatives. However the literature on implementing Green practices by university campuses is still in its infancy, an emphasis on sustainability has been argued to support IT practitioners enhance the use of IT infrastructures, while achieving a sustained university campus. While sustainability has gained increasing attention from researchers and academicians in organizations and industries, sustainability practice implementation in university sector is still not fully successful since IT practitioners currently uses manual based Green assessment methods. IT practitioners in university campuses lack the capability to assess their current Green practices automatically. Therefore there is need for architecture to support IT practitioners in assessing, benchmarking and rating their current Green practice implementation to ascertain if the sustainability goal of economic, people and environment is archived or if they need to improve their Green process implementation. To overcome the aforementioned problems this research proposes an agent based Green assessment architecture to evaluate the current practice implementation in university campuses automatically. The proposed Green assessment system architecture also provides Green process implementation suggestions to IT practitioners.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is emerging technology due to pay-as-you-go pricing model. It is spreading globally due to its easy and simple service oriented model. Some people are having perception that cloud computing is just another name of Internet. The numbers of users accessing the cloud are rising day by day. Cloud is based on data centers, which are powerful to handle large number of users, who can access their data anytime and anywhere. Data centers consumes huge amount of energy leads to increase cost and carbon emission. Large numbers of data centers are easy to build, but not good for environment. In cloud computing, users are available with different virtualized resources in order to complete their task, hence in cloud computing scheduling plays a vital role. In this paper, various algorithms are studied, analyzed & discussed by taking different parameters to resolve the issue of scheduling in servers, either by assigning virtual machines to server or by assigning tasks to various virtual machines. Heuristic scheduling algorithms like ACO and its different variants are discussed, further improvement can be done in order to make it more energy efficient algorithm.},

At the same time, without a mechanism for measuring the green ability of a particular software product executed in a specific environment, the mentioned benefits will not be guaranteed. Although sustainability and green can be accomplished when all dimensions are in balance, there is still a lack of balance measurements to achieve green products as needed by the industries and societies. The contributions of this study revolve around the works on green software measurements to attain a green software product from a sustainability's perspective. It provides a green measure structure consisting of the element, measurements, sub measurement, and metric.

The stakeholders of GSS are detailed with the services each stakeholder can provide and consume, thus clarifying their interests to GSS. Based on this analysis, we present the domain-independent, high-level requirements to GSS that cover diverse needs of different stakeholders. Six business models are then proposed to promote collaborations of stakeholders on the delivery of GSS.

	abstract = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},

	abstract = {Green Cloud Computing aims at a processing infrastructure that combines flexibility, quality of services, and reduced energy utilization. In order to achieve this objective, the management solution must regulate the internal settings to address the pressing issue of data center over-provisioning related to the need to match the peak demand. In this context, we propose an integrated solution for resource management based on organization models of autonomous agent components. This work introduces the system management model, analyzes the system's behavior, describes the operation principles, and presents a use case scenario. To simulate the approach of organization, theory and implementation of migration policies and reallocation changes were made as improvements in the code of CloudSim framework.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has recently received considerable attention. With the fast development of cloud computing, the data center is becoming larger in scale and consumes more energy. There is an emergency need to develop efficient energy-saving methods to reduce the huge energy consumption in the cloud data center. In this paper, we achieve this goal by dynamically allocating resources based on utilization analysis and prediction. We use ``Linear Predicting Method" (LPM) and ``Flat Period Reservation-Reduced Method" (FPRRM) to get useful information from the resource utilization log, and make M/M/1 queuing theory predicting method have better response time and less energy-consuming. Experimental evaluation performed on CloudSim cloud simulator shows that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the violation rate and energy-consuming in the cloud.},

	abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm is continually evolving, and with it, the size and the complexity of its infrastructure. Assessing the performance of a cloud environment is an essential but an arduous task. Further, the energy consumed by data centers is steadily increasing and major components such as the storage systems need to be more energy efficient. Cloud simulation tools have proved quite useful to study these issues. However, these simulation tools lack mechanisms to study energy efficient storage in cloud systems. This paper contributes in the area of cloud computing by extending the widely used cloud simulator CloudSim. In this paper, we propose CloudSimDisk, a scalable module for modeling and simulation of energy-aware storage in cloud systems. We show how CloudSimDisk can be used to simulate energy-aware storage, and can be extended to study new algorithms for energy-awareness in cloud systems. Our simulation results proved to be in accordance with the analytical models that were developed to model energy consumption of hard disk drives in cloud systems. The source code of CloudSimDisk is also made available for the research community for further testing and development.},
