	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to identify the important barriers for developing a long-term Artificial Intelligence (AI) cloud system in an Information Technology (IT) business. A fuzzy integrated hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model was established and applied to achieve this goal. In this ongoing analysis, Delphi was used to filter the most crucial ones from a list of 18 identified parameters, whereas, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the relevance of each parameter. Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) were further applied to identify the cause-effect relationship and to construct the hierarchical interrelationships among the parameters. Finally, to identify the driving and dependence parameters, Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) approach was used. The findings revealed that the most crucial elements in building a sustainable AI cloud system were technological, financial, and environmental concerns. More particularly, from all perspectives, digitalization is deemed to be the most critical within the group, with the greatest priority degree and significant driving as well as dependent tendency. According to ISM and MICMAC, user tendency to learn and R&D sector collaboration seems to be the most dependent and the independent factors respectively among the group. Remaining of the 13 factors are interrelated and operates as linkage obstacles. This study provides useful insights for IT firms trying to implement sustainable AI cloud systems and underlines the importance of including environmental and economic concerns into decision-making processes.},

@article{MOGHADDAM2021142,
	abstract = {Cloud service providers use load balancing algorithms in order to avoid Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) and wasted energy consumption due to host over- and under-utilization, respectively. Load balancing algorithms migrate VMs between hosts in order to balance host loads. Any Virtual Machines (VMs) that are migrated experience performance degradation which results in lower Quality of Service (QoS) and can possibly result in SLAVs. Hence, an optimal load balancing method should reduce the number of over- and under-utilized hosts with a minimal number of VM migrations. One of the metrics used previously in the literature for evaluating load balancing stated that it equally considered SLAVs caused by both over-utilized hosts and migrations. However, in this paper, we show that, in fact, this metric values keeping the number of migrations low at the expense of an increased number of over-utilized hosts. This disparity is demonstrated by simulation of Google, PlanetLab and Azure data sets in CloudSim. This metric may suit public cloud providers which are focused on minimizing SLAVs and keeping energy costs low, but does not consider the QoS of customer VMs. We propose an alternative metric that considers QoS for the VMs. This alternative metric considers not only performance loss during migration, but also performance degradation due to host over-utilization. Private cloud providers, e.g., IT services within large organizations, often value the performance of their ``customer'' VMs, i.e., the QoS their organization receives, as well as traditional cloud provider costs, i.e., energy and SLAV costs. Hence, our alternative metric would be more appropriate in these scenarios. We compare and contrast load balancing methods using both the existing, biased metric and our new alternative metric.},

@article{MAKARATZIS2018715,
	abstract = {There is a quite intensive research for Cloud simulators in the recent years, mainly due to the fact that the need for powerful computational resources has led organizations to use cloud resources instead of acquiring and maintaining private servers. In order to test and optimize the strategies that are being used on cloud resources, cloud simulators have been developed since the simulation cost is substantially smaller than experimenting on real cloud environments. Several cloud simulation frameworks have been proposed during the last years, focusing on various components of the cloud resources. In this paper, a survey on cloud simulators is conducted, in order to examine the different models that have been used for the hardware components that constitute a cloud data center. Focus is given on the energy models that have been proposed for the prediction of the energy consumption of data center components, such as CPU, memory, storage and network, while experiments are performed in order to compare the different power models used by the simulation frameworks. The following cloud simulation frameworks are considered: CloudSched, CloudSim, DCSim, GDCSim, GreenCloud and iCanCloud.},

@article{QUARATI2016403,
	abstract = {The flexible and pay-as-you-go computing capabilities offered by Cloud infrastructures are nowadays very attractive, and widely adopted by many organizations and enterprises. In particular this is true for those having periodical or variable tasks to execute, and, choose to not or cannot afford the expenses of buying and managing computing facilities or software packages, that should remain underutilized for most of the time. For their ability to couple the scalability offered by public service providers, with the wider Quality of Service (QoS) provisions and ad-hoc customizations provided by private Clouds, Hybrid Clouds (HC) seem a particularly appealing solution for customers requiring something more than the mere availability of the service. The paper firstly introduces a Cloud brokering system leveraging on a promising architectural approach, based on the use of a gateway toolkit. This approach provides noticeably advantages, both to customers and to Cloud Brokers (CB), for its ability to hide all the intricacies related to the management of powerful, but often complex and heterogeneous infrastructures like the Cloud. Moreover such approach, through customized interfaces, facilitates customers in accessing Cloud resources thus easing the tailored deployment and execution of their applications and workflows. The major contribution of this work is given by the analysis of a set of brokering strategies for Hybrid Clouds, implemented by a brokering algorithm, aimed at the execution of various applications subject to different user requirements and computational conditions. With the objective of firstly maximize both user satisfaction and CB's revenues the algorithm also pursues profit increases through the reduction of energy costs by adopting energy saving mechanisms. A simulation model is used to evaluate performance, and the results show that differences among strategies depend on type and size of system loads and that the use of turn on and off techniques greatly improves energy savings at low and medium load rates thus indirectly increasing CB revenues without diminishing customers' satisfaction.},

@article{LIN201847,
	abstract = {With rapid development of cloud computing technologies and applications, the number and scale of cloud data centers have grown exponentially in recent years. One of the major problems with current cloud data centers is their huge energy consumption, which makes energy consumption management one of the hottest research topics in the field of cloud computing. This paper aims at implementing an effective Distributed Energy Meter (DEM) system for heterogeneous cloud environments based on a multi-component power consumption model for cloud servers. Specifically, we propose a modeling method for the energy consumption of key components (CPU, memory and disk) of computer servers and reveal the mathematical relationship between the resource usage of the key components and the system energy consumption. The proposed DEM system cannot only estimate the energy consumption of heterogeneous cluster environments (Linux and Windows NT), but also support various CPU power consumption models. In addition, a unique disk power consumption model that uses different thresholds to distinguish various disk I/O states (sequential/random, read/write) to achieve an accurate estimation of disk power consumption. Experimental studies conducted on a heterogeneous cluster with workloads generated by PCMark and Sysbench demonstrate that the proposed DEM system outperforms the state-of-art models in estimating the energy consumption of heterogeneous cloud environments.},

	abstract = {The adoption of Green Information Technology (GIT) is important to ensure organizations' environmental performance through sustainable production, consumption, utilization and disposal of Information Technology (IT) devices. However, research on the adoption of GIT practices has mostly addressed organizational factors and outcomes, with limited emphasis on the cognitive and attitudinal factors associated with behavioral change. Based on the Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework, this research examined the effects of individual, social and organizational factors on GIT attitude among a sample of IT professionals in ISO 14001 certified IT companies in Malaysia and investigated the mediating effects of their beliefs about GIT. Further, this research investigated the relationship between GIT attitudes and behavioral change, as indicated through self-reported engagement in green computing practices. Survey methods were used to collect data from 333 respondents. The results support the direct effects of GIT knowledge, social influence and green management culture on GIT attitude. However, hypothesized indirect effects through the mediation of GIT beliefs were supported for GIT knowledge and social influence, but not for green management culture. The relationship between GIT attitude and engagement in green computing practices was supported. The implications of these results are discussed, and future research directions are suggested.},

	abstract = {Energy creates 35% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1]. Information technology (IT) is a significant end user of energy, consuming over 10% of commercial electricity [2]. 0.37GtCO2e of IT GHG emissions are attributed to end user computing (EUC) devices, such as desktop computers and notebooks [3]. The United Nations (UN) indicates combining existing technology innovative and behavioural changes has the potential to transform societies and reduce GHG emissions [4]. As the commercial and public sector transitions from desktops to notebooks [5], accurately identifying energy efficient mobile devices offers the ability to support this concept by reducing concomitant GHG emissions. However, accurately measuring device use phase energy (UPE) generated GHG emissions is elusive. Organisations currently avoid the direct measurement due to scale, complexity and logistical issues that cause the practice to become costly and therefore impractical [6]. As an alternative, EUC energy consumption is estimated based on typical electricity consumption (TEC) benchmark data, extrapolated by the number of users and then converted to GHG equivalent units. Conducting a field experiment measuring EUC energy consumption in a business environment, this research substantiates that accepted estimation methods introduce an error range between -48% to +107%. Consequently, the error causes EUC GHG scope 2 accounting to be underestimated by 30% and abatement opportunities of up to 55% to be overlooked.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) systems offer on demand virtual infrastructures so reliably and flexibly that users expect a high service level. Therefore, even with regards to internal IaaS behaviour, production clouds only adopt novel ideas that are proven not to hinder established service levels. To analyse their expected behaviour, new ideas are often evaluated with simulators in production IaaS system-like scenarios. For instance, new research could enable collaboration amongst several layers of schedulers or could consider new optimisation objectives such as energy consumption. Unfortunately, current cloud simulators are hard to employ and they often have performance issues when several layers of schedulers interact in them. To target these issues, a new IaaS simulation framework (called DISSECT-CF) was designed. The new simulator's foundation has the following goals: easy extensibility, support energy evaluation of IaaSs and to enable fast evaluation of many scheduling and IaaS internal behaviour related scenarios. In response to the requirements of such scenarios, the new simulator introduces concepts such as: a unified model for resource sharing and a new energy metering framework with hierarchical and indirect metering options. Then, the comparison of several simulated situations to real-life IaaS behaviour is used to validate the simulator's functionality. Finally, a performance comparison is presented between DISSECT-CF and some currently available simulators.},

The optimisation of energy consumption in both cloud computational clusters and computing servers is usually related to scheduling problems. The definition of an optimal scheduling policy which does not negatively impact to system performance and task completion time is still challenging. In this work, we present a new simulation tool for cloud computing, GAME-SCORE, which implements a scheduling model based on the Stackelberg game. This game presents two main players: a) the scheduler and b) the energy-efficiency agent. We used the GAME-SCORE simulator to analyse the efficiency of the proposed game-based scheduling model. The obtained results show that the Stackelberg cloud scheduler performs better than static energy-optimisation strategies and can achieve a fair balance between low energy consumption and short makespan in a very short time.},

The solution involves the control of clusters and the use of network traffic engineering methods to minimize overall energy consumption. The advantages of the hierarchical approach are twofold: first entities controlling parts of computing infrastructure may decide how much of their responsibility is delegated to the coordinator, next the computational complexity of related mathematical programming problems may be reduced, and their solution may be done in parallel. The mathematical programming problem of task allocation is defined in the centralized form first. After discussing its computation complexity and related organizational difficulties, it is decomposed to form a hierarchy. Finally, heuristics for allocation are proposed and verified via numerical simulation.},

Therefore, a major trade-off for simulators is the balance between abstraction level of the models, the scalability, and the performance of the executions. In order to balance better these, early forays can be found in the literature in which AI techniques are applied, but either lack of generality or are tailored to specific simulation frameworks. This paper describes the methodology to integrate memoization as a technique of supervised learning into any computing simulators framework. In this process, a bespoke kernel was constructed for the analysis of the energy models used in most well known computing simulators -cloud and fog-, but also to avoid simulation overhead. Finally, a detailed evaluation of energy models and its performance is presented showing the impact of applying supervised learning to computing simulator, showing performance improvements when models are more accurate and computations are dense.},

	abstract = {One of the significant limitations in the evaluation of hybrid clouds is the difficulty in validating new solutions by their deployment in real systems since replication of tests on large environments is usually highly expensive. To overcome these limitations, simulators have become popular for conducting preliminary tests. However, there is still a lack of simulation tools with easy-to-use code that allows handling diverse cloud scenarios and the simulation of energy consumption of all devices (hosts, switches, routers, and storage). To fill this gap, the simulator SinergyCloud has been developed to evaluate data centers in hybrid clouds. SinergyCloud allows evaluating diverse cloud scenarios, including energy consumption, workflow makespan, the completion time of tasks, and migrations of virtual machines, with a fine granularity of abstraction. SinergyCloud can handle the simulation of hybrid clouds with multiple data centers composed of hundreds of thousands of devices. Moreover, it is a Java-based, event-driven, and packet-level simulator, having a less steep learning curve than do other simulators. To show the feasibility of SinergyCloud, we performed accuracy and scalability analyses. Metrics values obtained by another simulator had less than 1% difference compared to SinergyCloud, demonstrating its accuracy. In terms of scalability, a scenario with 10,000 hosts was simulated in about 7 h using a typical personal computer. A comprehensive analysis of algorithms for the scheduling of virtual machines in a hybrid cloud is also presented, showing how to perform various evaluations.},

We present details of our extension into the HTC-Sim simulation framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance and energy impact of our responsive live migration approach in high throughput computing (HTC) systems with various migration policies. The proposed policies focus on which computer to select for migration from an HTC resource pool. We evaluate our migration policies through the use of our HTC-Sim simulation framework. Moreover, we compare the results between the policies as well as the system where migration is not considered. We demonstrate that our responsive migration could save approximately 75% of the system wasted energy due to job evictions by user interruptions where migration is not employed as a fault-tolerance mechanism.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of a plethora of embedded and portable applications, energy dissipation has joined throughput, area, and accuracy/precision as a major design constraint. Thus, designers must be concerned with both optimizing and estimating the energy consumption of circuits, architectures, and software. Most of the research in energy optimization and/or estimation has focused on single components of the system and has not looked across the interacting spectrum of the hardware and software. The novelty of our new energy estimation framework, SimplePower, is that it evaluates the energy considering the system as a whole rather than just as a sum of parts, and that it concurrently supports both compiler and architectural experimentation.We present the design and use of the SimplePower framework that includes a transition-sensitive, cycle-accurate datapath energy model that interfaces with analytical and transition sensitive energy models for the memory and bus subsystems, respectively. We analyzed the energy consumption of ten codes from the multidimensional array domain, a domain that is important for embedded video and signal processing systems, after applying different compiler and architectural optimizations. Our experiments demonstrate that early estimates from the SimplePower energy estimation framework can help identify the system energy hotspots and enable architects and compiler designers to focus their efforts on these areas.},

	abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) systems are large-scale computing systems with thousands of compute nodes. Massive energy consumption is a critical issue for HPC systems. In this paper, we develop an auction mechanism model for energy consumption reduction in an HPC system. Our proposed model includes an optimized resource allocation scheme for HPC jobs based on processor frequency and a Vickery-Clarke-Groove (VCG)-based forward auction model to enable energy reduction participation from HPC users. The model ensures truthful participation from HPC users, where users benefit from revealing their true valuation of energy reduction. We implement a job scheduler simulator and our mechanism model on a parallel discrete-event simulation engine. Through trace-based simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our auction mechanism model. Simulation shows that our model can achieve overall energy reduction for an HPC system, while ensuring truthful participation from the users.},

We develop a framework for visualizing information concerning power consumption of IT devices in real-time using power metering approaches and leverage semantic web technologies to weave information that is dispersed across different data sources, ranging from an organization's asset databases to excel spreadsheets to the data available on manufacturer's websites. Visualizing the aforementioned information and bringing it together in one application can help organizations in understanding and adapting their energy consumption behavior in order to better support environmentally sustainable practices. The purpose of this project, from a power analytics standpoint, is twofold: (1) it aims to provide users with insight into their device's current power consumption without leaving a footprint on their machine, and (2) to analyze if one method gives more accurate results than others. We performed analysis using Microsoft Joulemeter and power estimation using software design methodologies (with numbers from smart meters as our benchmark).},

	abstract = {Massive data centers housing thousands of computing nodes have become commonplace in enterprise computing, and the power consumption of such data centers is growing at an unprecedented rate. Adding to the problem is the inability of the servers to exhibit energy proportionality, i.e., provide energy-efficient execution under all levels of utilization, which diminishes the overall energy efficiency of the data center. It is imperative that we realize effective strategies to control the power consumption of the server and improve the energy efficiency of data centers. With the advent of Intel Sandy Bridge processors, we have the ability to specify a limit on power consumption during runtime, which creates opportunities to design new power-management techniques for enterprise workloads and make the systems that they run on more energy proportional.In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to achieve energy proportionality for an enterprise-class server workload, namely SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark, by using Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interfaces. First, we analyze the power consumption and characterize the instantaneous power profile of the SPECpower benchmark within different subsystems using the on-chip energy meters exposed via the RAPL interfaces. We then analyze the impact of RAPL power limiting on the performance, per-transaction response time, power consumption, and energy efficiency of the benchmark under different load levels. Our observations and results shed light on the efficacy of the RAPL interfaces and provide guidance for designing power-management techniques for enterprise-class workloads.},

Employing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study therefore set out to examine the influence of factors such as attitude, social influence, media influence, perceived behavioral control and environmental concern on the IT worker's green computing intention. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 149 respondents within a large financial services firm in Gauteng. Descriptive statistics suggest that personal awareness, knowledge and actual green computing behaviors are low. Regression analysis indicates that environmental concern, perceived behavioral control, attitude, and media influence are important predictors while social influence plays almost no role -- suggesting that IT workers are under no social pressure to practice green computing. The paper recommends that responsible peers, firms, higher education institutions, and media focus their attention on driving environmental awareness in order to promote green computing behaviors among seemingly unaware and disempowered IT workers.},

In the software engineering field, the topic has received increasing attention in recent years, with several studies addressing a range of concerns. However, few studies have demonstrated the awareness of software practitioners about the underlying concepts of sustainability in the software development practice. In this effect, in this study, we aim to provide some evidence about the practitioners' perception about the adoption of sustainability in software development, under four main perspectives: economic, social, environmental and technical. To accomplish such a goal, we carried out a survey study with twenty-five software engineers involved in projects in different domains. The yielded results indicate an overall lack of knowledge about the topic, in particular regarding the concepts about sustainable software, although it is a common understanding that sustainability should be treated as a quality attribute and should support the interaction between sustainability and the software development life cycle phases. Among the observed perspectives, the respondents indicate that the technical dimension is the most relevant and explored so far. This study contributes to the field with initial evidence and can be seen as a first step towards establishing a common understanding about how the software industry is receptive to the use of sustainability concepts in software development practices.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, sustainability is a key factor that should be considered in the software quality models. It is increasingly important how environmentally friendly is a software product, both in its execution and during its development process. Therefore, we have proposed, in a previous work, a quality model (25010+S) an extension of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by considering aspects of sustainability on its characteristics and sub-characteristics. However, in order to make the model useful, it is necessary to identify measures for each sub-characteristic and characteristic. For that reason, the objective of this paper is to carry out a Systematic Literature Review to discover the state-of-the art in software sustainability measures.},

Most past research has been focused on the definitions, metrics and technical solutions for green software, but few has addressed green software from the business perspective. In this paper, we present the analysis on three key elements of Green Software Services (GSS)---stakeholders, their requirements, and business models. The stakeholders of GSS are detailed with the services each stakeholder can provide and consume, thus clarifying their interests to GSS. Based on this analysis, we present the domain-independent, high-level requirements to GSS that cover diverse needs of different stakeholders. Six business models are then proposed to promote collaborations of stakeholders on the delivery of GSS. In the end, the relationship between GSS and cloud is discussed and a GSS marketplace is envisioned.},

The paper discusses the relevance of considering environmental factors in modern computing and then describes how simulation can be combined with scheduling metaheuristics in order to reduce the expected time needed to complete a set of tasks in a server under the realistic assumption of stochastic processing times. This, in turn, allows for a reduction in average energy consumption, which makes the computing facility more efficient from an environmental perspective. Some experiments have been carried out in order to illustrate these potential savings.},

This is especially desirable when workflows are large or there is a desire to run a workflow multiple times. Much research has been conducted in reducing the makespan of running workflows and maximising the utilisation of the resources they run on, with some existing research investigates how to reduce the energy consumption of workflows on dedicated resources. We extend the HTC-Sim simulation framework to support workflows allowing us to evaluate different scheduling strategies on the overheads and energy consumption of workflows run on non-dedicated systems. We evaluate a number of scheduling strategies from the literature in an environment where (workflow) jobs can be evicted by higher priority users.},

However, until recently little evaluation has been performed on the energy impact of HTC. Many organisations now seek to minimise energy consumption across their IT infrastructure though it is unclear how this will affect the usability of HTC systems. We present here HTC-Sim, a simulation system which allows the evaluation of different energy reduction policies across an HTC system comprising a collection of computational resources dedicated to HTC work and resources provided through cycle scavenging--a Desktop Grid. We demonstrate that our simulation software scales linearly with increasing HTC workload.},

In this paper, we present the simulation of an energy-efficient economic demand-response model based on contract theory. Simulation is developed to examine the effectiveness of the demand-response model in a variety of real-world scenarios. Results from simulation show that the model can achieve energy efficiency through the rewarding mechanism of the contract-based design. In particular, the HPC users can be properly compensated to ensure their willing participation in energy reduction.},

	abstract = {Smart technologies are everywhere and the creation of a smart world, from smart devices to smart cities is rapidly growing to potentially improve quality of life. Businesses, governments, and individual users of smart technology expect a level of service and access to data that is achieved through data and supercomputing centers. These centers potentially consume vast amounts of power and their continued growth may be unsustainable and contribute to greenhouse gasses. As smart technologies rely heavily on such computational capabilities their sustainability is pivotal for a smart future. This paper explores the literature to: identify the problems; categorize the challenges as well as possible solutions; explore how simulation and machine learning can improve computational sustainability; and consider the need to conduct trade-off analysis to determine when to apply simulation and machine learning benefits. A taxonomy for sustainable computing is presented for future research.},

	abstract = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},
