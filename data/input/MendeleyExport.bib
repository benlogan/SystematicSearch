   abstract = {Context: The energy efficiency of IT systems, also referred to as Green IT, is attracting more and more attention. While several researchers have focused on the energy efficiency of hardware and embedded systems, the role of application software in IT energy consumption still needs investigation. Objective: This paper aims to define a methodology for measuring software energy efficiency and to understand the consequences of abstraction layers and application development environments for the energy efficiency of software applications. Method: We first develop a measure of energy efficiency that is appropriate for software applications. We then examine how the use of application development environments relates to this measure of energy efficiency for a sample of 63 open source software applications. Results: Our findings indicate that a greater use of application development environments - specifically, frameworks and external libraries - is more detrimental in terms of energy efficiency for larger applications than for smaller applications. We also find that different functional application types have distinctly different levels of energy efficiency, with text and image editing and gaming applications being the most energy inefficient due to their intense use of the processor. Conclusion: We conclude that different designs can have a significant impact on the energy efficiency of software applications. We have related the use of software application development environments to software energy efficiency suggesting that there may be a trade-off between development efficiency and energy efficiency. We propose new research to further investigate this topic. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The book consists of thirteen chapters, which are structured in five parts. First the “Introduction” gives an overview of the primary general concepts related to Green IT, discussing what Green in Software Engineering is and how it differs from Green by Software Engineering. Next "Environments, Processes and Construction" presents green software development environments, green software engineering processes and green software construction in general. The third part, “Economic and Other Qualities,” details models for measuring how well software supports green software engineering techniques and for performing trade-off analyses between alternative green practices from an economic perspective. "Software Development Process" then details techniques for incorporating green aspects at various stages of software development, including requirements engineering, design, testing, and maintenance. In closing, “Practical Issues” addresses the repercussions of green software engineering on decision-making, stakeholder participation and innovation management. The audience for this book includes software engineering researchers in academia and industry seeking to understand the challenges and impact of green aspects in software engineering, as well as practitioners interested in learning about the state of the art in Green in Software Engineering.},

Traditionally, energy efficiency research has focused on reducing energy consumption at the hardware level. Nevertheless, the software itself provides numerous opportunities for improving energy efficiency. Goal: Given that energy efficiency for IT systems is a rising concern, we investigate existing work in the area of energy-aware software development and identify open research challenges. Our goal is to reveal limitations, features, and tradeoffs regarding energy-performance for software development and provide insights on existing approaches, tools, and techniques for energy-efficient programming. Method: We analyze and categorize research work mostly extracted from top-tier conferences and journals concerning energy efficiency across the software development lifecycle phases. Results: Our analysis shows that related work in this area has focused mainly on the implementation and verification phases of the software development lifecycle. Existing work shows that the use of parallel and approximate programming, source code analyzers, efficient data structures, coding practices, and specific programming languages can significantly increase energy efficiency. Moreover, the utilization of energy monitoring tools and benchmarks can provide insights for the software practitioners and raise energy-awareness during the development phase.},

Most of the efforts spent on Green ICT/IT have been dedicated to addressing the effects of hardware on the environment but little have been considering the effects of building software products as well. Efficient software will indirectly consume less energy by using up less hardware equipment to run. Our contributions in this paper are devoted to building a two level green software model that covers the sustainable life cycle of a software product and the software tools promoting green and environmentally sustainable software. In the first level we propose a new green software engineering process that is a hybrid process between sequential, iterative, and agile development processes to produce an environmentally sustainable one. Each stage of the software process is then further studied to produce a green and sustainable stage. We propose either green guidelines or green processes for each software stage in the engineering process. We add to the software life cycle the requirements stage and the testing stage. We also include in the first level a complete list of metrics to measure the greenness of each stage in terms of the first order effects of ICT on the environment for a green software engineering process. No effort has been placed before in designing a green software engineering process. The second level explains how software itself can be used as a tool to aid in green computing by monitoring resources in an energy efficient manner. Finally, we show and explain relationships that can be found between the two levels in our proposed model to make the software engineering process and product green and sustainable.},

In this sense, there is a need for additional quality requirements to include sustainability concerns, as well as to examine the market equilibrium where stakeholders and customers meet. In Most cases, software development companies do not consider the explicit representation of sustainability requirements such as resource utilization, or customers concerns on sustainability. In this work, we focus on the relationship between customers, who require energy efficient software products, and software development companies, who offer these software products. The proposed introductory model aims to determine the demand and payoff functions by satisfying both sides with the quality level of the product and its price.},

   abstract = {Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demands adequate levels of awareness and actions to address sustainability challenges. Software systems will play an important role in moving towards these targets. Sustainability skills are necessary to support the development of software systems and to provide sustainable IT-supported services for citizens. While there is a growing number of academic bodies, including sustainability education in engineering and computer science curricula, there is not yet comprehensive research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop such systems. This study aims to identify the industrial sustainability needs for education and training from software engineers' perspective. We conducted interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed to achieve their goals. Our findings show that organisations are interested in sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons. They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter difficulties, like the trade-off between short-term financial profitability and long-term sustainability goals. To fill the gaps, they have promoted in-house training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to external training. The acquired competencies make sustainability an integral part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking, soft skills, technical sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements, values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying.},

Software development should not remain indifferent to the need to construct software products that contribute towards sustainability, both during their creation and throughout their use. However, one of the main gaps is the difficulty of measuring the energy consumption when software is executed in order to detect, for example, parts of the software with excessive energy consumption. For that reason, a Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve eNviromental Goals of the Software (FEETINGS) has been proposed. In this paper, we focus on the core of the framework, that is, the Energy Efficiency Tester (EET), which is the measurement hardware device devoted to collecting the specific consumption data of the software under evaluation. The architecture and the main functions of EET, along with the reliability validation done with it are presented here, as well as an analysis of the data extracted from a case study conducted. The outcome of such analysis shows that EET is able to carry out stable energy consumption measurements of executed software.},

   abstract = {Energy consumption of software has been becoming increasingly significant, since it can vary according to how the software has been developed. In recent years, developers and researchers have been interested in analyzing, among other things, how energy consumption evolves when changes occur from one version to another in any given software. Thus far, the only studies available are theoretical papers that reinforce the idea that maintainability may have an influence on energy use, but this needs to be proven empirically, which is the goal of this article. This work presents an empirical study carried out to test whether there is a relationship between the energy consumption and the maintainability of several versions of Redmine. Maintainability has been assessed by means of different measures, such as the number of lines of code, or the complexity of the software, calculated using SonarCloud, and the energy consumption measurements have been captured using the EET device. The results obtained show that the number of lines of code affects both the energy consumption of the processor and the total consumption of the computer where the software is run. It is intended that the results from this work should serve as a basis for the undertaking of new empirical studies which will enable the relationship between the software maintainability and the energy efficiency of that software to be better understood.},

   abstract = {Context Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which is challenging to maintain and evolve in response to the inevitable changes in stakeholder goals and requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice. Problem Accidental software complexity accrues both naturally and gradually over time as part of the overall software design and development process. From a software architecture perspective, this allows several issues to overlap including, but not limited to: the accumulation of technical debt design decisions of individual components and systems leading to coupling and cohesion issues; the application of tacit architectural knowledge resulting in unsystematic and undocumented design decisions; architectural knowledge vaporisation of design choices and the continued ability of the organization to understand the architecture of its systems; sustainability debt and the broader cumulative effects of flawed architectural design choices over time resulting in code smells, architectural brittleness, erosion, and drift, which ultimately lead to decay and software death. Sustainable software architectures are required to evolve over the entire lifecycle of the system from initial design inception to end-of-life to achieve efficient and effective maintenance and evolutionary change. Method This article outlines general principles and perspectives on sustainability with regards to software systems to provide a context and terminology for framing the discourse on software architectures and sustainability. Focusing on the capacity of software architectures and architectural design choices to endure over time, it highlights some of the recent research trends and approaches with regards to explicitly addressing sustainability in the context of software architectures. Contribution The principal aim of this article is to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.},

In particular, while the state of the art investigated the impact of some specific code refactorings on dedicated benchmarks, we miss an assessment that those apply to more comprehensive and complex software. To address this threat, this paper studies the evolution of the energy consumption of 7 open-source software developed for more than 5 years. Then, by focusing on the impact on energy consumption of changes involving code refactorings, we intend to assess the effects induced by such code refactorings in practice. For all these software systems we studied, our empirical results report that the code refactorings we mined do not substantially impact energy consumption. Interestingly, these results highlight that i) structural code refactorings bring energy-preserving changes to the code, and ii) major energy variations seem to be related to functional and computational code evolutions.},

   abstract = {To mitigate the growing carbon footprint of computing systems, there has been an increasing focus on carbon-aware approaches that seek to align the power usage of IT infrastructure with the availability of clean energy. Unfortunately, research on carbon-aware applications and the required interfaces between computing and energy systems remain complex, due to the scarcity of available testing environments. To this day, almost all new approaches are evaluated on self-implemented simulation testbeds, which leads to repeated development efforts by researchers and low comparability of approaches. In this paper, we present our vision of a co-simulation testbed for carbon-aware applications and systems. We envision a versatile testbed which lets users connect domain-specific simulators for components like renewable power generation, energy storage, and power flow analysis with real software and hardware. By providing extensibility on the one hand and access to state-of-the-art implementations, datasets, and best practices on the other, we hope to accelerate research in carbon-aware computing. In addition, a co-simulation testbed can be useful for development and operations, like in continuous testing. We implemented a first prototype of our idea and welcome the community to contribute to this vision.},

   abstract = {Cloud computing is a paradigm that delivers technology resources on demand through service virtualization. Virtualization allows sharing of hardware by applications compartmentalized into multiple independent modules. Microservices architecture uses the ability of virtualization to adopt a software architecture approach based on building applications composed of several interdependent and loosely coupled modules. However, microservices architec-tures can incur large energy costs to achieve the required levels of performance and availability. Several research topics related to energy consumption in mi-croservice architectures have already been explored, such as elasticity, reliability , performance, and availability. However, given the variety of problems and solutions, identifying research trends and gaps related to microservices is complex. We aim to systematically identify, rank, and compare existing research trends and gaps around energy consumption in microservices. This paper presents a systematic review of energy consumption in microservices ar-chitectures. This work also provides a list of references to find the mapped works, thus being able to guide searches more safely. The paper selection started with 3625 papers, followed by three refinement processes in which 37 papers were selected for a full review. The remaining 37 papers were cataloged and classified according to some criteria, such as metrics, evaluation method and type of architecture. Thus, the review revealed research gaps and trends in energy consumption in microservices architectures. In addition, significant research challenges and directions were identified. The research challenges are 2 Gabriel Araújo ± et al. presented based on the metrics that guide each work in this systematic review: performance, elasticity, scalability, reliability, sustainability, and availability.},

   abstract = {Reducing energy consumption of software is an increasingly important objective, and there has been extensive research for data centers, smartphones, and embedded systems. However, when it comes to software, we lack working tools and methods to directly reduce energy consumption. For performance , we can resort to configuration options for tuning response time or throughput of a software system. For energy , it is still unclear whether the underlying assumption that runtime performance correlates with energy consumption holds, especially when it comes to optimization via configuration. To evaluate whether and to what extent this assumption is valid for configurable software systems, we conducted the largest empirical study of this kind to date. First, we searched the literature for reports on whether and why runtime performance correlates with energy consumption. We obtained a mixed, even contradicting picture from positive to negative correlation, and that configurability has not been considered yet as a factor for this variance. Second, we measured and analyzed both the runtime performance and energy consumption of 14 real-world software systems. We found that, in many cases, it depends on the software system's configuration whether runtime performance and energy consumption correlate and that, typically, only few configuration options influence the degree of correlation. A fine-grained analysis at the function level revealed that only few functions are relevant to obtain an accurate proxy for energy consumption and that, knowing them, allows one to infer individual transfer factors between runtime performance and energy consumption.},

In addition to their functional and extra-functional properties, nowadays' systems are also evaluated by their sustainability properties. The next generation of systems will be characterized by an overall elevated sustainability-including their post-life, driven by efficient value retention mechanisms. Current systems engineering practices fall short to support these ambitions and need to be revised appropriately. In this paper, we introduce the concept of circular systems engineering, a novel paradigm for systems sustainability. After defining a conceptual reference framework to situate systems engineering practices within, we derive prerequisites for circular systems engineering.

Consequently, computing accounts for an increasing amount of global energy usage, contradicting the objective of sustainable computing. The lack of hardware support and the absence of a standardized, software-centric method for the precise tracing of energy provenance exacerbates the issue. Aiming to overcome this challenge, we argue that fine-grained software energy attribution is attainable, even with limited hardware support. To support our position, we present a thread-level, NUMA-aware energy attribution method for CPU and DRAM in multi-tenant environments. The evaluation of our prototype implementation, EnergAt, demonstrates the validity, effectiveness, and robustness of our theoretical model, even in the presence of the noisy-neighbor effect. We envisage a sustainable cloud environment and emphasize the importance of collective efforts to improve software energy efficiency.},

With this study, we aim to provide a review of AK concepts and their representation and communication from a practical point of view. Having this understanding, we explore where sustainability can be applied in daily practice and how we can address sustainability in architecture processes in the future.

   abstract = {Context: Over the years, software systems experienced a growing popularization. With it, the energy they consume witnessed an exponential growth, surpassing the one of the entire aviation sector. Energy efficiency tactics can be used to optimize software energy consumption. Objectives: In this work, we aim at understanding the state of the art of energy efficient tactics, in terms of activities in the field, tactic properties, tactic evaluation rigor, and potential for industrial adoption. Method: We leverage a systematic literature review based on a search query and two rounds of bi-directional snowballing. We identify 142 primary studies, reporting on 163 tactics, which we extract and analyze via a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Results: The research interest in the topic peaked in 2015 and then steadily declined. Tactics on source code static optimizations and application level dynamic monitoring are the most frequently studied. Industry involvement is limited. This potentially creates a vicious cycle in which practitioners cannot apply tactics due to low industrial relevance, and academic researchers struggle to increase the industrial relevance of their findings. Conclusions: Despite the energy consumed by software is a growing concern, the future of energy efficiency tactics research does not look bright. From our results emerges a call for action, the need for academic researchers and industrial practitioners to join forces for creating real impact.},

As global energy consumption is projected to surpass supply by 2030, the need to optimize energy consumption in programming has become imperative. Our study explores the energy efficiency of various coding patterns and techniques in Python, with the objective of guiding programmers to a more informed and energy-conscious coding practices. The research investigates the energy consumption of a comprehensive range of topics, including data initialization, access patterns, structures, string formatting, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming and performance comparisons between NumPy and Pandas, and personal computers versus cloud computing. The major findings of our research include the advantages of using efficient data structures, the benefits of dynamic programming in certain scenarios that saves up to 0.128J of energy, and the energy efficiency of NumPy over Pandas for numerical calculations. Additionally, the study also shows that assignment operator, sequential read, sequential write and string concatenation are 2.2 times, 1.05 times, 1.3 times and 1.01 times more energy-efficient choices, respectively, compared to their alternatives for data initialization, data access patterns, and string formatting. Our findings offer guidance for developers to optimize code for energy efficiency and inspire sustainable software development practices, contributing to a greener computing industry.},

As a result, there is a growing demand for energy-efficient software; however, this demand remains unmet due to the lack of knowledge regarding the best practices for reducing energy consumption in software. Unnecessary iterations and faulty looping conditions in different loops can consume high energy, and loops are considered as one of the most energy consuming entities. Aim: The purpose of this thesis is to detect and rectify energy code smells in different Java loop types by implementing static code analysis. Method: Using the DSR approach, a Java Maven custom SonarQube plugin was developed. The plugin underwent in-house testing as well as evaluation by professionals. The professionals had provided feedback, which were later analyzed by using a qualitative method. Results:For internal testing, 16 different open-source Java projects were selected. The results demonstrated considerable variations in the prevalence of energy code smells across the projects. Additionally, the plugin provided sample code suggestions to address each identified energy code smell. Finally, from the industry experts review, the plugin received an overall rating of Very Good. Conclusion: The plugin had successfully detected code smells and suggested code samples to rectify the detected code smells. However, it cannot be overlooked that the plugin may also generate false positives.},

However, one of the main gaps is the difficulty of measuring the energy consumption when software is executed in order to detect, for example, parts of the software with excessive energy consumption. For that reason, a Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve eNviromental Goals of the Software (FEETINGS) has been proposed. In this paper, we focus on the core of the framework, that is, the Energy Efficiency Tester (EET), which is the measurement hardware device devoted to collecting the specific consumption data of the software under evaluation. The architecture and the main functions of EET, along with the reliability validation done with it are presented here, as well as an analysis of the data extracted from a case study conducted.

   abstract = {Energy of computing is a serious environmental concern and mitigating it is an important technological challenge. Accurate measurement of energy consumption during an application execution is key to application-level energy minimization techniques. There are three popular approaches to providing it: (a) System-level physical measurements using external power meters; (b) Measurements using on-chip power sensors and (c) Energy predictive models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study comparing the accuracy of state-of-the-art on-chip power sensors and energy predictive models against system-level physical measurements using external power meters, which we consider to be the ground truth. We show that the average error of the dynamic energy profiles obtained using on-chip power sensors can be as high as 73% and the maximum reaches 300% for two scientific applications, matrix-matrix multiplication and 2D fast Fourier transform for a wide range of problem sizes. The applications are executed on three modern Intel multicore CPUs, two Nvidia GPUs and an Intel Xeon Phi accelerator. The average error of the energy predictive models employing performance monitoring counters (PMCs) as predictor variables can be as high as 32% and the maximum reaches 100% for a diverse set of seventeen benchmarks executed on two Intel multicore CPUs (one Haswell and the other Skylake). We also demonstrate that using inaccurate energy measurements provided by on-chip sensors for dynamic energy optimization can result in significant energy losses up to 84%. We show that, owing to the nature of the deviations of the energy measurements provided by on-chip sensors from the ground truth, calibration can not improve the accuracy of the on-chip sensors to an extent that can allow them to be used in optimization of applications for dynamic energy. Finally, we present the lessons learned, our recommendations for the use of on-chip sensors and energy predictive models and future directions.},

   abstract = {Cloud computing has become the de facto paradigm for delivering software to system users, with organizations and enterprises of all sizes making use of cloud services in some way. On the surface, adopting the cloud appears to be a very efficient approach for offloading concerns such as infrastructure management, logistics, and most importantly for this work, energy consumption and consequent carbon emissions to the cloud service provider. However, this is in many ways not an appropriately accountable solution to managing the contribution of the ICT sector to global emissions. To this effect, in this paper we report on an exploratory case study done in collaboration with a Software as a Service provider operating globally in the telecommunications sector. The study reckons with the service provider using multi-tenant, that is, shared, off-premises data centers for hosting their private cloud infrastructure towards developing a fair model of allocating operational emissions among the service tenants -- customer companies with many distinct users. The developed emissions model has to account for allocating in an appropriate manner the generated emissions between the tenants of the software provider services, and among the different tenants of the same data center. A carbon footprint report generator is developed building on the proposed model which is, in turn, used to present sustainability reports to involved stakeholders for evaluation purposes. Our results show that the model is perceived as transparent, informative, and fair, with requested improvements focusing mainly on the generated reports and the information contained therein.},

The findings can guide the Green IT implementation and sustainable initiatives across the organization from six dimensions: organizational, technological, economic, environmental, social and marketing. The framework enables the development diagnosis and assessment of Green IT practices present in the organization.

Accurately calculating the emissions of digital technologies is a complex task where there are no clear standards for methodologies or boundaries for what should be included in these calculations. Nevertheless, a number of online carbon calculators exist to quantify carbon emissions of ICT. The starting question in this paper is how much such tools can inform and provide insight to people working with ICT innovation to take action to reduce the environmental impacts from the products, services and systems they create. To explore this question, we analyse ICT carbon calculators from a digital innovation designer's perspective, exploring what they enable those creating ICT to see and understand, as well as the limitations of these views on carbon. We argue that these approaches are limited and that a better way to address the issue is by moving from designing carbon calculators to co-designing a framework for responsible innovation that enables systems thinking, exposes complexities, helps with the assessment of carbon emissions without fixating on numbers, and supports evaluation and visualisation of future scenarios.},

This paper introduces Google's system for Carbon-Intelligent Compute Management, which actively minimizes electricity-based carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by delaying temporally flexible workloads. The core component of the system is a suite of analytical pipelines used to gather the next day's carbon intensity forecasts, train day-ahead demand prediction models, and use risk-aware optimization to generate the next day's carbon-aware Virtual Capacity Curves (VCCs) for all datacenter clusters across Google's fleet. VCCs impose hourly limits on resources available to temporally flexible workloads while preserving overall daily capacity, enabling all such workloads to complete within a day. Data from operation shows that VCCs effectively limit hourly capacity when the grid's energy supply mix is carbon intensive and delay the execution of temporally flexible workloads to "greener" times.},

   abstract = {Cloud computing has become the de facto paradigm for delivering software to system users, with organizations and enterprises of all sizes making use of cloud services in some way. On the surface, adopting the cloud appears to be a very efficient approach for offloading concerns such as infrastructure management, logistics, and most importantly for this work, energy consumption and consequent carbon emissions to the cloud service provider. However, this is in many ways not an appropriately accountable solution to managing the contribution of the ICT sector to global emissions. To this effect, in this paper we report on an exploratory case study done in collaboration with a Software as a Service provider operating globally in the telecommunications sector. The study reckons with the service provider using multi-tenant, that is, shared, off-premises data centers for hosting their private cloud infrastructure towards developing a fair model of allocating operational emissions among the service tenants -- customer companies with many distinct users. The developed emissions model has to account for allocating in an appropriate manner the generated emissions between the tenants of the software provider services, and among the different tenants of the same data center. A carbon footprint report generator is developed building on the proposed model which is, in turn, used to present sustainability reports to involved stakeholders for evaluation purposes. Our results show that the model is perceived as transparent, informative, and fair, with requested improvements focusing mainly on the generated reports and the information contained therein.},

   abstract = {As the need for cloud services has been growing steadily, the size and energy consumption of datacenters have increased significantly over the past years. Due to economic and environmental constraints, energy efficiency in datacenters and greenhouse emissions have become a major concern. Renewable energy is widely seen as a promising solution to supply datacenters using local energy, without greenhouse gas emissions. However, the intermittent power generation resulting from the use of renewable energy imposes a paradigm change in the way energy and computation activities are managed. On the one hand, service placement and scheduling may be used on the IT (information technologies) side to adapt to the available power. On the other hand, the storage units may be used to lessen power generation variations. Existing literature and actual deployment mainly design optimization algorithms including the entire system (from cloud service to electrical management, the latter often being neglected or simplified). Conversely to these approaches, we propose a solution where each side optimizes its own objectives, both interacting through a negotiation loop process to reach a common agreement. In this paper, we present DATAZERO, a project developing this idea to ensure high availability of IT services, avoiding unnecessary redundancies, under the constraints due to the intermittent nature of electrical and cloud services flows.},

   abstract = {As the power demand of datacenters is increasing sharply, a promising solution is to power datacenters locally by renewable energies. However, one of the main challenges when operating such green datacenters is to conciliate the intermittent power supply and the power demand. To deal with this problem, we view the green datacenter as two sub-systems, namely, Information Technology (IT) sub-system which consumes energy, and electrical sub-system which supplies energy. The objective is to find an efficient trade-off between the power demand and power supply, respecting the operational requirements of both sub-systems (i.e., the requirements on utility, or monetary gain, which includes monetary revenue and monetary cost). First, we analyze the problem by a black-box approach. In this approach, the models of the two sub-systems are unknown to each other, and the two sub-systems negotiate by exchanging their power preferences. However, we found that the black-box approach cannot guarantee stable solutions in term of execution time and generational distance (which is the distance between a solution and the Pareto front). Then we introduce a semi black-box approach, in which the two sub-systems are modeled as the buyer and the supplier in a buyer–supplier negotiation game. We propose an algorithm that allows the buyer and supplier to negotiate, seeking for an efficient trade-off between the power demand and power supply. The analytical results show that the semi black-box algorithm converges to equilibrium, and these results are then confirmed by experimental results. We conduct the experiments by implementing a middleware of a datacenter powered by renewable energies. The experimental results show that the semi black-box algorithm improves significantly the stability, quality of service (QoS) and utility of the datacenter, compared to other algorithms. In term of stability, compared to the black-box algorithm, the semi black-box algorithm reduces the standard deviation of execution time and generational distance by 23 and 27 times, respectively. In term of QoS and utility, the semi black-box algorithm outperforms the algorithms that do not consider joint IT-energy management, as well as the algorithms that do not utilize a semi black-box design.},

   abstract = {Data centers represent today's major energy consumers. This is especially true in the Netherlands, informally called "the data center country" for Amsterdam includes 33% of the data centers of the whole European Union. To address this problem, the Dutch Government initiated the MJA (Meerjarenafspraken, or in English multiannual agreements), a nationwide initiative intended to improve energy efficiency of ICT products, services and processes. Major energy consumers, like data centers, actively participate in the MJA initiative to lower and optimize their energy consumption. To this end, the MJA members have documented the green ICT practices developed so far. The resulting documentation consists of an excel sheet of 83 consolidated practices. As a way to formalize, classify and share green practices, in our previous work we have proposed a green strategy model and have mapped the MJA practices accordingly. In this way we made explicit the fundamental knowledge elements of a green practice, namely the MJA green goals, green practices, and practice's effects. In this work, we take a further step into the content of the codified practices, by: i) classifying the practices based on the concerns they address, ii) looking into the goals that data centers intend to achieve in relation to the concerns that practices address, iii) classifying the practices based on the role that IT plays, and iv) distinguishing practices that are software-related from non-software related ones. In this way, we provide a picture of how data centers currently address the problem of reducing their energy footprint, possibly offering inspiration to both researchers (in progressing in their research further from what already exists), and practitioners (in reusing practices and learning what knowledge elements are important for informed decision making). © 2013 The Authors.

   abstract = {<p>In recent years, the application of green renewable energy to data centers has become an important trend. Traditional solutions lack the consideration of matching tasks to renewable energy supplies. Therefore, in the face of diverse real-time computing tasks, how to reduce the total energy cost while ensuring the quality of service is an important challenge for the data center in the future. In this paper, our focus is on using the information on renewable energy supply and task characteristics as input states to assign tasks that maximize user satisfaction while meeting the minimum total cost of energy consumption. We consider the diversity of real-time tasks and design three different task types: the most crucial task, the crucial task and the non-crucial task. According to the different characteristics of these tasks, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on multi-agent, which uses multiple sets of agents with different initial positions to parallel search in different dimensions of the parameter space to find the optimal solution. To further optimize the algorithm, we eliminate the centralized noise solution based on the Pareto sorting method and sort the multiple optimal solutions to highlight the most suitable solution. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm compared with other algorithms can reduce the total energy consumption by 11% and increase the customer satisfaction by 13% on average, and has better performance and applicability.</p>},

These systems essentially rely on "what-if" analysis to determine what the consequence of their actions would be and to choose the best one according to a number of metrics. However, modeling energy consumption of simple operations such as starting a new VM or live-migrating is complicated by the fact that multiple phenomena occur. It is therefore important to identify which factors influence energy consumption before proposing any new model. We claim in this paper that one critical parameter is the host configuration, characterized by the number of VMs it is currently executing. Based on this observation, we present an energy model that provides energy estimation associated with VM management operations, such as VMs placement, VM start up and VM migration. The average relative estimation error is lower than 10% using the transactional web benchmark TPC-W, making it a good candidate for driving the actions of future energy-aware cloud management systems.},

The successful application of such schemes necessitates a careful analysis so that the amount of degradation of the SLAs with respect to power savings can be quantified helping the data center operators to set up the optimal configuration. In this paper, we study and analyze a system consisting of a data center, its operator, and IT clients under the consideration of relaxed SLAs. For this purpose, we consider a data center system consisting of two heterogeneous pools of servers, where each server is modeled using the single-server system with a power-saving inactive state, non-zero (random) ac-tivation/deactivation times, and hot standby state. Making use of the distributional Little's Law, derive the steady-state performance (in terms of response time distribution) and average power demand and study the power-performance trade-off in an explicit way. Numerical results illustrate the model's theoretical properties, under different considerations of low, medium, and high workload utilization rates.

In order to exploit the hub-internal operational dispatchability and flexibility, a comprehensive energy consumption model of data center buildings is proposed to facilitate the demand response in terms of available serves, while the variable speed pumped storage (VSPS) is modeled to capture its dynamic operational characteristics. The energy‑carbon production, conversion, storage, and consumption are formulated as an energy‑carbon matrix, which are solved via a two-stage method to obtain the optimal portfolio. Case studies on southwest China data center buildings are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology on cost-effective accommodation of RESs. Simulations results show that the system portfolio cost can be reduced by at most 17.8% with a higher operational flexibility.},

The global data center industry accounts for a significant proportion of the world's energy consumption. A partial or total transition of the energy sources that power the operation of data centers to cleaner energy, particularly onsite renewable technologies, will help to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals established in international agreements. However, integrating such technologies is difficult due to the intermittency and availability of renewable sources. Nevertheless, temporal and geographical flexibility for processing part of the data centers’ workload provides an opportunity to efficiently integrate these renewable energy sources. In this paper, we develop an operational scheme for a network of interconnected data centers with a significant electricity supply from onsite technologies consisting of (i) an optimal job migration and scheduling policy for data centers to match their operation and the availability of renewable energy under an emissions cap-and-trade program; (ii) an energy management system to control the data centers’ onsite renewable and grid energy resources; and (iii) a robust optimization approach to account for the intermittency of the renewables and to identify the optimal migration and scheduling policies under the worst-case scenario. A case study is carried out to assess the economic and environmental impacts. The results indicate that the installation of onsite technologies and an optimal migration policy reduce the operational costs and the greenhouse gas emissions of the networks of data centers.},

In the current scenario, most of the services are migrated to the cloud, putting more load on the cloud data centres. As a result, the data center’s size expands resulting in increased energy usage. To address this problem, a resource allocation optimisation method that is both efficient and effective is necessary. The optimal utilisation of cloud infrastructure and optimisation algorithms plays a vital role. The cloud resources rely on the allocation policy of the virtual machine on cloud resources. A virtual machine placement technique, based on the Harris Hawk Optimisation (HHO) model for the cloud data centre is presented in this paper. The proposed HHO model aims to find the best place for virtual machines on suitable hosts with the least load and power consumption. PlanetLab’s real-time workload traces are used for performance evaluation with existing PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) and PABFD (Best Fit Decreasing). The performance evaluation of the proposed method is done using power consumption, SLA, CPU utilisation, RAM utilisation, Execution time (ms) and the number of VM migrations. The performance evaluation is done using two simulation scenarios with scaling workload in scenario 1 and increasing resources for the virtual machine to study the performance in underloaded and overloaded conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed HHO algorithm improved execution time(ms) by 4%, had a 27% reduction in power consumption, a 16% reduction in SLA violation and an increase in resource utilisation by 17%. The HHO algorithm is also effective in handling dynamic and uncertain environments, making it suitable for real-world cloud infrastructures.},

   abstract = {Energy efficiency is increasingly important for future information and communication technologies (ICT), because the increased usage of ICT, together with increasing energy costs and the need to reduce green house gas emissions call for energy-efficient technologies that decrease the overall energy consumption of computation, storage and communications. Cloud computing has recently received considerable attention, as a promising approach for delivering ICT services by improving the utilization of data centre resources. In principle, cloud computing can be an inherently energy-efficient technology for ICT provided that its potential for significant energy savings that have so far focused on hardware aspects, can be fully explored with respect to system operation and networking aspects. Thus this paper, in the context of cloud computing, reviews the usage of methods and technologies currently used for energy-efficient operation of computer hardware and network infrastructure.After surveying some of the current best practice and relevant literature in this area, this paper identifies some of the remaining key research challenges that arise when such energy-saving techniques are extended for use in cloud computing environments.},

As a result, cloud service providers are seeking innovative ways that allow them to reduce the amount of energy that their data centers consume. They are calling for the development of new energy-efficient techniques that are suitable for their data centers. The services offered by the cloud computing paradigm have unique characteristics that distinguish them from traditional services, giving rise to new design challenges as well as opportunities when it comes to developing energy-aware resource allocation techniques for cloud computing data centers. In this article we highlight key resource allocation challenges, and present some potential solutions to reduce cloud data center energy consumption.

   abstract = {Data center energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction have attracted a great deal of attention across the world for some years now, and recently more than ever. Live Virtual Machine (VM) migration is a prominent solution for achieving server consolidation in Local Area Network (LAN) environments. With the introduction of live Wide Area Network (WAN) VM migration, however, the challenge of energy efficiency extends from a single data center to a network of data centers. In this paper, intelligent live migration of VMs within a WAN is used as a reallocation tool to minimize the overall carbon footprint of the network. We provide a formulation to calculate carbon footprint and energy consumption for the whole network and its components, which will be helpful for customers of a provider of cleaner energy cloud services. Simulation results show that using the proposed Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based method for live VM migration can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a cloud network compared to the consolidation of individual data center servers. In addition, the WAN data center consolidation results show that an optimum solution for carbon reduction is not necessarily optimal for energy consumption, and vice versa. Also, the simulation platform was tested under heavy and light VM loads, the results showing the levels of improvement in carbon reduction under different loads. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Executive Summary We know that cloud-based computing can reduce IT capital costs, reduce labor costs, and enhance productivity. And a growing body of evidence shows the cloud is also remarkably efficient. 1 Last year we released a paper on the energy savings from using Gmail instead of locally hosted email. 2 Here, we expand on that analysis to include the cloud-based office applications of Google Apps. Our estimates, which we've supported with a case study from a Google Apps client, show that migrating basic IT applications to Google Apps significantly reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions. Based on our analysis, a typical company or organization that migrates to the cloud could: • save an estimated 68-87% in energy for its office computing • reduce similar amounts of carbon emissions These findings are consistent with a case study presented in this paper of the actual savings achieved by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), a Google Apps client with approximately 17,000 users. By switching to Google Apps, GSA reduced server energy consumption by nearly 90% and carbon emissions by 85%. We estimate the cost savings from this reduction in energy use will be $285,000 annually (a 93% reduction). Background: the cloud-based services that we analyzed},

Cloud-based data centers provide high performance computing power to analyze voluminous IoT data to provide invaluable insights to support decision making. However, multifarious servers in data centers appear to be the black hole of superfluous energy consumption that contributes to 23% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) industry. IoT-related energy research focuses on low-power sensors and enhanced machine-to-machine communication performance. To date, cloud-based data centers still face energy-related challenges which are detrimental to the environment. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation is a well-known approach to affect energy-efficient cloud infrastructures. Although several research works demonstrate positive results for VM consolidation in simulated environments, there is a gap for investigations on real, physical cloud infrastructure for big data workloads. This research work addresses the gap of conducting real physical cloud infrastructure-based experiments. The primary goal of setting up a real physical cloud infrastructure is for the evaluation of dynamic VM consolidation approaches which include integrated algorithms from existing relevant research. An open source VM consolidation framework, Openstack NEAT is adopted and experiments are conducted on a Multi-node Openstack Cloud with Apache Spark as the big data platform. Open sourced Openstack has been deployed because it enables rapid innovation, and boosts scalability as well as resource utilization. Additionally, this research work investigates the performance based on service level agreement (SLA) metrics and energy usage of compute hosts. Relevant results concerning the best performing combination of algorithms are presented and discussed.},

How does computation contribute to the warming of the planet? As information technology (IT) capacity demands continue to trend upward, what are some of the ecological obstacles that must be overcome to accommodate an ever-expanding, carbon-hungry Cloud? How do these material impacts play out in everyday life, behind the scenes, where servers, fiber optic cables, and technicians facilitate cloud services? This case study draws on firsthand ethnographic research in data centers-sprawling libraries of computer servers that facilitate everything from email to commerce-to identify some of the far-reaching and tangled environmental impacts of computation and data-storage infrastructures. It surveys a range of empirical accounts of server technicians to illustrate on-the-ground examples of material and ecological factors that permeate everyday life in the Cloud. These examples include air conditioning and thermal management, water cycling, and the disposal of e-waste. By attending to the culture of workplace practice and the behaviors and training of technicians in data centers, this case study reveals that the Cloud is not fully automated, nor is it hyperrational; emotion, instinct, and human judgment are enlisted to keep servers running. This case study closes with a speculative vignette that scales up from various local impacts to a planetary framework, sketching some of the particular ways that computation contributes to climate change and the Anthropocene.},

   abstract = {Virtualisation is a major technology in cloud computing for optimising the cloud data centre’s power usage. In the current scenario, most of the services are migrated to the cloud, putting more load on the cloud data centres. As a result, the data center’s size expands resulting in increased energy usage. To address this problem, a resource allocation optimisation method that is both efficient and effective is necessary. The optimal utilisation of cloud infrastructure and optimisation algorithms plays a vital role. The cloud resources rely on the allocation policy of the virtual machine on cloud resources. A virtual machine placement technique, based on the Harris Hawk Optimisation (HHO) model for the cloud data centre is presented in this paper. The proposed HHO model aims to find the best place for virtual machines on suitable hosts with the least load and power consumption. PlanetLab’s real-time workload traces are used for performance evaluation with existing PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) and PABFD (Best Fit Decreasing). The performance evaluation of the proposed method is done using power consumption, SLA, CPU utilisation, RAM utilisation, Execution time (ms) and the number of VM migrations. The performance evaluation is done using two simulation scenarios with scaling workload in scenario 1 and increasing resources for the virtual machine to study the performance in underloaded and overloaded conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed HHO algorithm improved execution time(ms) by 4%, had a 27% reduction in power consumption, a 16% reduction in SLA violation and an increase in resource utilisation by 17%. The HHO algorithm is also effective in handling dynamic and uncertain environments, making it suitable for real-world cloud infrastructures.},

We show that the capabilities of even decade-old smartphones are within those demanded by modern cloud microservices and discuss how to combine phones to perform increasingly complex tasks. We describe how current operation-focused metrics do not capture the actual carbon costs of compute. We propose Computational Carbon Intensity - -a performance metric that balances the continued service of older devices with the superlinear runtime improvements of newer machines. We use this metric to redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones. We analyze the carbon benefits of deploying large, end-to-end microservice-based applications on these smartphones.

Manufacturing emissions are disclosed in the sustainability reports of semiconductor companies. This paper proposes a study of global semiconductor manufacturing carbon emissions, focusing on Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (emissions induced by consuming energy). The fifteen companies on the semiconductor market with highest 2021 revenues are considered, as well as the four main merchant foundries, over the years 2020 and 2021. As a large scale evaluation of carbon impacts, the resulting numbers compile heterogeneous figures and require a comprehensive discussion on the strengths and limitations of the evaluation. Most of the efforts on this paper are thus allocated to this discussion. The 2021 carbon emissions for the semiconductor industry worldwide are estimated at 76.5M tons of CO2 equivalent, breaking down into 30.6M tons CO2e of Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions), and 45.9M tons CO2e of scope 2 emissions (emissions induced by the energy consumption of manufacturing). These numbers do not include the Scope 3 impacts, neither downwards (usage of the products) nor upwards (constructing fabrication facilities, building fabrication machines, extracting raw materials, smelting and refining materials).

   abstract = {Scalable Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have revolutionized the way we store and access our data across datacenters and handheld devices. Unfortunately, scaling technology can have a significant environmental impact. Across the globe, most semiconductor manufacturing use electricity that is generated from coal and natural gas. For instance, manufacturing a Gigabyte of Flash emits 0.16 Kg CO$_2$ and is a significant fraction of the total carbon emission in the system. We estimate that manufacturing storage devices has resulted in 20 million metric tonnes of CO$_2$ emissions in 2021 alone. To better understand this concern, this paper compares the sustainability trade-offs between Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and SSDs and recommends methodologies to estimate the embodied carbon costs of the storage system. In this paper, we outline four possible strategies to make storage systems sustainable. First, this paper recommends directions that help select the right medium of storage (SSD vs HDD). Second, this paper proposes lifetime extension techniques for SSDs. Third, this paper advocates for effective and efficient recycling and reuse of high-density multi-level cell-based SSDs. Fourth, specifically for hand-held devices, this paper recommends leveraging elasticity in cloud storage.},

   abstract = {In the post-Moore's Law era, relying solely on hardware advancements for automatic performance gains is no longer feasible without increased energy consumption, due to the end of Dennard scaling. Consequently, computing accounts for an increasing amount of global energy usage, contradicting the objective of sustainable computing. The lack of hardware support and the absence of a standardized, software-centric method for the precise tracing of energy provenance exacerbates the issue. Aiming to overcome this challenge, we argue that fine-grained software energy attribution is attainable, even with limited hardware support. To support our position, we present a thread-level, NUMA-aware energy attribution method for CPU and DRAM in multi-tenant environments. The evaluation of our prototype implementation, EnergAt, demonstrates the validity, effectiveness, and robustness of our theoretical model, even in the presence of the noisy-neighbor effect. We envisage a sustainable cloud environment and emphasize the importance of collective efforts to improve software energy efficiency.},

   abstract = {Software energy consumption is a performance related non-functional requirement that complicates building software on mobile devices today. Energy hogging applications (apps) are a liability to both the end-user and software developer. Measuring software energy consumption is non-trivial, requiring both equipment and expertise, yet researchers have found that software energy consumption can be modelled. Prior works have hinted that with more energy measurement data we can make more accurate energy models. This data, however, was expensive to extract because it required energy measurement of running test cases (rare) or time consuming manually written tests. In this paper, we show that automatic random test generation with resource-utilization heuristics can be used successfully to build accurate software energy consumption models. Code coverage, although well-known as a heuristic for generating and selecting tests in traditional software testing, performs poorly at selecting energy hungry tests. We propose an accurate software energy model,GreenScaler, that is built on random tests with CPU-utilization as the test selection heuristic. Green-Scaler not only accurately estimates energy consumption for randomly generated tests, but also for meaningful developer written tests. Also, the produced models are very accurate in detecting energy regressions between versions of the same app. This is directly helpful for the app developers who want to know if a change in the source code, for example, is harmful for the total energy consumption. We also show that developers can use GreenScaler to select the most energy efficient API when multiple APIs are available for solving the same problem. Researchers can also use our test generation methodology to further study how to build more accurate software energy models.},

In spite of the overwhelming advances in processing ability, adoption of sophisticated applications is hindered by the fear of shorter battery life. This is one of the several reasons software developers are becoming conscious of writing energy efficient code. Research has been conducted to model software energy consumption, to reduce energy drains, and to understand developers expertise on energy efficiency. In this paper, however, we investigate the nature of energy-aware software projects. We observed that projects concerned with energy issues are larger and more popular than the projects that do not address energy consumption. Energy related code changes are larger than others (e.g., bug fixes). In addition , our initial results suggest that energy efficiency is mostly addressed on certain platforms and applications.},

Models and tools that estimate software energy consumption can save developers time, as application profiling is much easier and more widely available than hardware instrumentation for measuring software energy consumption. Our work focuses on modelling software energy consumption by using system calls and machine learning techniques. This system call based model is validated against actual energy measurements from five different Android applications. These results demonstrate that system call counts can successfully model software energy consumption if the idle energy consumption of an application is estimated or known. In the absence of any knowledge of an application's idle energy consumption, our system call based approach is still useful to compare the energy consumption among different versions of the same application.},

By generating images on demand instead of storing and transmitting images, the energy and carbon emissions associated with them could be reduced, alongside page load times as clients would no longer need to wait for an entire image to be downloaded. This paper is a feasibility study of how using image generation techniques can address these issues, and is also an exploration of the benefits that dynamically generated images can bring to the internet, both in terms of energy savings and speed.},

   abstract = {Sustainability is a reality and a necessity for everyone in all areas. The changes that are taking place with respect to environmental sensitivity force organizations to adopt a new approach to this problem. This has led organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)to develop standards that help all types of organizations achieve sustainable development, such as the ISO 14000 family of standards. However, the ISO 14000 family of standards is too generic and does not address specific areas that are highly relevant for organizations in the search for sustainability, as is the case of the area of Information Technology (IT). From the area of IT, sustainability and, in particular, the Green IT philosophy have become slogans for executive, corporate, and service management. Implementing Green IT initiatives has become a priority for the environmental awareness of organizations that want to stay ahead of the curve. That is why, in this study, the application/inclusion of the ISO 14000 family of standards to IT is carried out. The results obtained and the validation of this proposal by experts show an adequate and consistent proposal, which covers all areas related to IT. All this demonstrates the applicability of the ISO 14000 family of standards to IT through the Green IT and completes a developed framework that is useful in practice when implementing the governance and management of Green IT. Likewise, thanks to this proposal, organizations finally have a standardized guide when implementing Green IT, as well as when seeking for international and recognized certifications in this field.},

The expansion of their use should be balanced by the results of the studies on the negative effects on the environment. The relationship between these technologies and the environment is relatively new. The application of environmental criteria is commonly referred to as green ICT or green computing. Awareness of the importance of the ecosystem has led to increased interest in its protection both in production and in consumption. Green ICT should be a major concern not only for the hardware and software producers but also for the users. They could stimulate the demand for less harmful products for the environment with an essential role in the after-sales stages. Companies can contribute to this process by resource efficiency, dematerialization, and minimizing e-waste, increasing recycling, and producing fewer CO2 emissions. The decision to adopt green ICT depends on the expected benefits and investments. This decision depends on costs, competitiveness, financial support, managers and employees’ characteristics and skills, legal regulations, supply, and demand. The contributions of the paper cover identifying, analysing and classifying general and specific determinants of green ICT adoption in organizations based on the literature in this field.},

This conceptual model and its associated hypotheses were empirically tested using a dataset generated from a survey of 405 organizations. The results suggest that coercive pressure influences the attitude toward Green IS adoption while mimetic pressure does not. In addition, we found that there was a significant relationship between Green IS adoption, attitude, and consideration of future consequences. Finally, we found that only long term Green IS adoption was positively related to environmental performance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We accomplish this by analyzing a unique data set combining surveys of corporate IT, GHG emissions and environmental practices with other secondary sources that contain financial and environmental metrics. We find that high levels of Enterprise Support IS Capability combined with the adoption of firm GHG pollution reduction targets help to reduce firm GHG emissions. On the other hand, the adoption of reduction targets in less IS-capable firms is associated with higher emissions. Our research highlights the role of information technology in firm sustainability programs and the value of information to pollution reduction.

This paper aims to address this gap by examining the role played by corporate social responsibility in the adoption of Green IT. We consider two different corporate social responsibility policies and different typologies of Green IT. We believe that corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a role in the adoption of Green IT and different CSR strategies induce the implementation of different types of Green IT in the firms. We utilise a survey carried out in Luxembourg on firms' CSR practices together with a community survey on information and communication technology usage by enterprises. Our estimations show that corporate social responsibility is a driver of Green IT adoption. We also show that strategic and responsive CSR induce the adoption of different types of Green IT based on the intensity of changes but all CSR strategies have the same effect on Green IT typology based on the moment when Green IT is adopted.},

In the field of Information Technologies (IT) several Green IT practices have been proposed, but in isolation, so a framework is needed if the Green IT is to be implemented and improved in an efficient and integrated way. In this paper, we propose a maturity model (based on ISO/IEC 15504) to help organizations implement the governance and management of Green IT gradually, as well as to improve their maturity level in this area. The validation of this proposal by experts and a case study seems to indicate that the proposal can be useful for implementing and improving the Green IT processes in organizations.},

   abstract = {Context: The changes that are taking place with respect to environmental sensitivity are forcing organizations to adopt a new approach to this problem. Implementing sustainability initiatives has become a priority for the social and environmental awareness of organizations that want to stay ahead of the curve. One of the business areas that has, more than others, proven to be a vital asset and a potential ally of the environment, is the area of Information Technology (IT). Through this area, Green IT practices advocate sustainability in and by IT. However, organizations have a significant handicap in this regard, due to the lack of specific Green IT standards and frameworks that help them carry out this type of sustainability practices. Objective: We have developed the “Governance and Management Framework for Green IT” (GMGIT), which establishes the necessary characteristics to implement Green IT in organizations, from the point of view of the governance and management of this area. After developing and validating a first version of this framework, we have performed a set of improvements, obtaining the GMGIT 2.0, which we want to validate. Method: We have conducted a series of empirical validations at international level based on case studies, whose characteristics and results are presented in this study. Results: The results of this multi-case study show an example of the current situation of organizations in Green IT, as well as the resolution of problems encountered during the validations conducted with the GMGIT 1.0. Conclusion: The findings obtained demonstrate the usefulness, applicability, and validity of the framework when implementing, auditing, and improving Green IT in organizations in a systematic and progressive manner.},

This paper aims to understand the factors that affect the adoption of Green Information Technology in the context of a developing country. Studies that have focused on both individual and organizational level factors (multi-level approach) remain limited. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical lens to address the gap in the literature. The theoretical background and participatory case study (qualitative) as the methodology was used to investigate the factors at multiple levels that could affect Green IT implementation in the developing country context (Indian business school). The findings reveal that three key dimensions affect the implementation of Green IT- Need, Scope, and the Inclination to adopt Green IT. Each dimension includes a mix of factors at the individual and organizational levels. This paper contributes to the theory by proposing a framework for multi-level Green IT adoption. It also provides guidelines to the practitioners for considering the intervention factors at the individual and organizational levels.},

This paper empirically investigates the influence of organizational eco-sustainability motivations on the adoption of Green IT. Drawing from the motivational theory and using data collected from a survey of 176 organizations, the paper develops and tests four hypotheses. The result shows that eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness motives influence the adoption of technologies that improve the energy efficiency of IT infrastructure and subsequent pollution reduction. They also explain variations in the adoption of policy and practices that aim to improve product stewardship of the IT lifecycle from procurement to end of life management.

Green information systems (Green IS) initiatives can assist organizations in reaching their environmental goals by providing the ability to reduce the environmental impacts of information technology (IT) manufacturing, operations and disposal; facilitate transparency and enhance the efficiency of organizational resources and business processes; and foster eco-products through technological innovation. However, the nature and type of benefits such initiatives can accrue remain poorly understood, and accordingly, IT executives struggle to integrate environmental aspects in the corporate strategy and to launch Green IS initiatives. This paper clarifies the mechanisms that link organizational beliefs about environmental sustainability to Green IT and Green IS actions undertaken, and the organizational benefits that accrue from these actions. Using data from a global survey of 118 senior-level IT executives, we find that Green IS strategies mediate the relationship between environmental orientation and the implementation of Green IT practices and Green IS practices, which in turn lead to organizational benefits in the form of cost reductions, corporate reputation enhancement and Green innovation capabilities. Our findings have implications for the potential of IS to enable organizations' environmental sustainability and also for the differentiation of Green IT and Green IS practices.},

Rooted in the principles of degrowth technology, digital so-briety advocates for reduced technology usage to create a more sustainable society. However, it contrasts with typical frameworks that promote the continued use of IT. Furthermore, it runs counter to the prevailing trend of digital transformation within organisations, which is expected to expand in the future. As a result, it challenges conventional approaches to  IT  usage and the  associated contextual factors. The purpose of  this paper is  to investigate the concept of digital sobriety, examining its relationship to conventional approaches as well as the degrowth technology perspective. The study explores how digital sobriety is implemented within organisations and how it is perceived by IT users. Thirty-three participants from IT companies were included and the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon of digital sobriety were identified, including five levels of IT user maturity: refutation, inaction, substitution, optimisation, and disadoption/degrowth. The results highlight the  need to balance the internal and external factors of digital sobriety and identify different trajectories of digital sobriety as socio-technical imaginaries for the future of IT.},

This case study applies the green IT adoption model (GITAM) to perform a systematic and qualitative readiness assessment at a major South African IT services vendor. Thematic data analysis was used to analyse the data collected from managers and specialist IT staff. The assessment revealed that the main organisational adoption readiness barriers were the lack of a formal green IT policy, an unclearly defined green IT governance framework, and a lack of green performance management. The main drivers of adoption were economic imperatives and regulatory and ethical requirements. Interestingly, a contextual variable – an exogenous shock caused by COVID-19 and the robustness of the organisation’s crisis response during the pandemic – rapidly increased the rate of green IT adoption at the firm.

Abstract This research delves into the integration of sustainable IT practices within contemporary IT service operations, recognizing their pivotal role in environmental responsibility and operational efficiency. The study begins by contextualizing the growing importance of green IT and outlining its multifaceted benefits. The core of the research elaborates on various green IT initiatives, including energy-efficient hardware, virtualization, e-waste management, paperless workflows, and remote work arrangements. These initiatives not only reduce environmental impact but also lead to substantial cost savings and improved corporate social responsibility. Real-world case studies spotlight organizations that have effectively incorporated green IT practices.

   abstract = {This article aims to identify the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities that underpin a strategic orientation for sustainability performance in order to reduce carbon emissions. These micro-foundations are examined in relation to two types of strategic orientation for sustainability performance: instrumental and stewardship. A qualitative research design is used to investigate four Dutch stock-listed companies with either an instrumental or a stewardship strategic orientation. The research shows that certain micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities achieve carbon emission reductions. Sensing, through measuring carbon emissions, supports a transparent raising of awareness on this issue. Seizing is based on a collaborative and carbon-driven capturing of value enabled by clear financial incentives linked to reducing carbon emissions. Transforming is supported by an ambidextrous organizational structure and the active diffusion of knowledge concerning carbon emission reduction. Top management can deliver a significant impulse to achieve the desired level of influence related to carbon emission reduction. Our analysis reveals five dimensions (level of influence, level of transparency, level of responsibility, logic of value creation, and logic of embeddedness) that explain the relation between a strategic orientation for sustainability performance and the associated sustainable performance achieved in carbon emission reduction.},

Such principles relate to a range of aspects of human activities requiring urgent attention, including heating, mobility, food security, and sustainable agriculture. One of the fields contributing to the transition towards a sustainable society is that of green information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the implementation of educational programs in green ICT is important in ensuring further ICT development around sustainability concerns. This article describes the development of an international Master's degree program named “Pervasive computing and communications for sustainable development” (PERCCOM) by an international consortium, which aimed to combine advanced ICT with environmental, economic, and social awareness. The article presents background information regarding the role of the ICT sector in environmental challenges, and a review of the literature, in order to understand what is required of ICT and green ICT graduates. The curriculum of the PERCCOM program is then described and findings on program improvement are reported. The article is aimed at academic and research professionals in the fields of sustainable development and green technologies, with the goal of improving educational initiatives to address the societal demand for sustainable development. The findings reported here contribute toward the search for a solution for sustainability, especially regarding environmental issues, among educating professionals with high expertise in networking, computing, and programming, who are able to design, develop, deploy, and maintain both pervasive computing systems and communication architectures for sustainable development.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Sustainable development (SD) does not usually form part of the curriculum of ICT-related study programs such as Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems, and Informatics. However, many topics form a bridge between SD and ICT and could potentially be integrated into ICT-related study programs. This paper reports the findings of a study into which specific topics in the field of SD have the greatest potential to motivate students on ICT-related study programs to engage with the topic of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: In this exploratory study, the authors evaluated Bachelor’s and Master’s courses that introduced the topic of SD to students on ICT-related study programs. The evaluation focuses on the insights that the students gained into sustainability and the extent to which their motivation to engage with the subject was increased. The evaluation combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Findings: The authors identify five thematic clusters with the greatest potential to motivate students to engage with the topic of sustainability: A conceptual model of the positive and negative impacts of ICT; Reports on the recycling of ICT hardware; Examples of using ICT to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a focus on the substitution of virtual for physical presence; Statistical data on post-industrial seemingly dematerialized economies and the contradiction with regard to the total material demand of such economies; Evidence for rebound effects that lead to increasing demand for goods or services that are produced with less energy input or can be consumed faster. Originality/value: ICT is a transformational and to a certain extent disruptive technology. It is therefore important to discuss the development of ICT and its applications in the context of SD. Several authors have pointed out the need to integrate the topic of sustainability into ICT courses at universities and similar, but few have discussed how this can be done in practice. Our study is the first to explore which topics have the greatest potential to motivate students on ICT-related programs to engage with the area of SD.},

As the world continues to face environmental challenges, educational institutions have a responsibility to adopt eco-friendly practices and reduce their carbon footprint. This abstract highlights the importance of incorporating Green ICT initiatives in higher secondary schools and the benefits they bring in terms of environmental conservation and educational development. Green ICT encompasses various strategies and technologies aimed at minimizing the environmental impact of ICT systems. In the context of higher secondary schools, it involves implementing energy-efficient hardware, optimizing power consumption, adopting virtualization and cloud computing, and promoting sustainable digital practices. By implementing these measures, schools can significantly reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize electronic waste. The integration of Green ICT in higher secondary schools offers numerous benefits. The promotes sustainability and environmental consciousness among students and staff, fostering a sense of responsibility towards the planet. Students can actively engage in environmental projects, learn about the importance of energy conservation, and apply sustainable practices in their daily lives. Additionally, the adoption of energy-efficient technologies helps schools reduce operational costs, allowing them to allocate more resources to educational programs and initiatives. Green ICT provides opportunities for innovative teaching and learning methods. Schools can leverage digital resources, such as online educational platforms, virtual simulations, and collaborative tools, to enhance the learning experience.

It is a follow up to a study of ICT in Sweden 2010. Several studies predict that the ICT and E&M sectors will continue to increase their energy and carbon footprints, and in the case of ICT exponentially similar to the data traffic increase. This study shows that in fact the opposite trend is seen in Sweden, the footprints have started to decrease despite a continuing exponential increase in data traffic. The study is based on a large share of measured data and Sweden is world-leading in many ICT and E&M metrics, thus it can be seen as an exellent case study and guide on how ICT and E&M will develop globally in the future. This study shows that the energy and carbon footprints of the ICT and E&M sectors have decreased from a peak at around 2010. The increasing trend of using tablets and smartphones with a low energy consumption (small screens) instead of PCs and TVs is an important contributing factor. Despite that the sales of PCs and TVs have decreased by nearly 20%, the embodied carbon footprint from their manufacturing processes abroad are still the largest source of ICT related carbon emissions in Sweden. The carbon footprint related to operation is low due to the low-carbon Swedish electricity mix. Based on current trends and network plans, it can be forecasted that the energy and carbon footprints of the ICT and the E&M sectors will continue to decrease at least until 2020.},

An electricity consumption function has been estimated by using panel data, depending on gross value added (GVA), temperatures, capitalization , and human capital. This function is obtained for total productive electricity consumption and for the agricultural, construction, industrial, service, and public administration sectors, referring to the 17 Autonomous Communities of Spain for the 2000-2013 period. The obtained results show important sectoral differences in the effect that GVA has on electricity consumption, indicating a positive and increasing effect of temperatures above 22 °C in the total economy and in the tertiary sector, and a negative effect of temperatures below 18 °C in some sectors. These results may indicate that global warming may induce an electricity demand growth in Spain, especially related to cooling needs. The results also highlight the positive effects of capitalization in all sectors, and the negative effects of human capital, except for the public administration sector. In this context, it may be appropriate to carry out policies that mitigate this consumption growth, reinforcing energy efficiency measures, and human capital investments.},

Asian nations’ ICT penetration has significantly expanded in recent years, and they are eager to bring about a digital revolution by building up their ICT infrastructure while consuming less energy for transportation and urban growth. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to investigate how ICT might reduce CO2 emissions through the use of transport energy and urban development. Empirical and theoretical debates have been remaining ambiguous and contentious topic of whether energy consumed by the transport sector and urbanization causes CO2 emanation in Asia, and what role ICT played in determining the level of CO2 remains unanswered. This study adds to the ongoing discussion for sustainable transportation in ten Asian nations for 30 years that concentrate on the relationship between the energy consumption of transport, urbanization, ICT, and carbon emanation (1990–2020) and checked the validity of EKC. The STIRPAT and panel threshold models having two regimes are used to explore the stochastic impacts of the dependent and explanatory variables. We have divided explanatory into two categories, that is, the threshold variable ICT and the regime-dependent variables urbanization and transport energy consumption. Our results confirm that the EKC hypothesis holds in these Asian economies. Thus, our findings indicate that the environmental quality improves in terms of reduction in CO2 emissions when ICT passes the threshold level due to the technological advancement in ICT dominating the scale effect induced by ICT. Furthermore, the possible policy recommendations are discussed according to the findings.},

In upper-middle-income economies, INTER and EPC inhibited GTFP, whereas MOB significantly promoted GTFP. Furthermore, INTER significantly promoted GTFP, MOB significantly inhibited GTFP, and EPC did not affect GTFP in high-income economies. The results based on EPC regulation showed that the interaction of ICT and EPC played a role in promoting GTFP in lower-middle-income economies. The opposite result was observed in upper-middle-income economies. Furthermore, the INTER and EPC interaction items promoted GTFP in high-income economies, whereas the MOB and EPC interaction items inhibited the GTFP.

   abstract = {New digital technologies help to curtail those that are carbon intensive but are accompanied by CO2 emissions due to their own energy demand. Whether digitalization relates to increased or decreased carbon emissions may depend on the sophistication of an economy's research and development (R&D) output. This study explores the R&D-induced regime transition that governs the relationship between digitalization and CO2 emissions. The study seeks evidence of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and tests it with a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR). Employing this estimator with two R&D output regimes makes it possible to account for year- and country-varying effects of digitalization, human capital, and country income level on CO2 emission. The research covers 55 high- and middle-income economies from 1996 to 2019. The paper finds that the transition process is driven by R&D output level – measured in technology patents per country inhabitants. The findings support the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and confirm that CO2 emissions have an inverted U-shaped relationship with digitalization and income level. This nonlinear relationship transitions smoothly in the exogenous R&D output level. The digitalization indicator in the lower R&D regime has a significant point estimate of 0.07; in the higher regime, the estimate is −0.14. The R&D output threshold at which the transition function switches between the two regimes corresponds to a level of 39.9 technology patents per million inhabitants.},

When the DE was integrated into the measurement framework of the CRE, the CRE of Chinese cities ranged from 40.7% to 99.1%, with a mean value of 58.4%, indicating that the actual carbon reduction in Chinese cities under the DE was only approximately 40% of that expected. Meanwhile, the CRE of Chinese cities is characterized by cyclical fluctuations and a spatial distribution pattern of “inland to coastal decreasing,” and the polarization effect gradually appears. It is worth noting that the DE significantly contributed to CRE. It will enhance energy efficiency and promote economic growth, which will increase energy consumption through the “substitution effect,” “income effect,” and “output effect,” thus inducing and expanding the urban CRE.},

The increased popularity of cryptocurrencies since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 has been accompanied by an increasing trend in greenhouse gas emissions and high electrical energy consumption. Popular energy tracking studies (e.g., Digiconomist and the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI)) have estimated energy consumption ranges of 29.96 TWh to 135.12 TWh and 26.41 TWh to 176.98 TWh respectively for Bitcoin as of July 2021, which are equivalent to the energy consumption of countries such as Sweden and Thailand. The latest estimate by Digiconomist on carbon footprints shows a 64.18 Mt$CO_2$ emission by Bitcoin as of July 2021, close to the emissions by Greece and Oman. This review compiles estimates made by various studies from 2018 to 2021. We compare with the energy consumption and carbon footprints of these cryptocurrencies with countries around the world, and centralized transaction methods such as Visa. We identify the problems associated with cryptocurrencies, and propose solutions that can help reduce their energy usage and carbon footprints.

Contrary to previous research, our findings reveal that green cryptocurrencies do not exhibit hedge or safe haven properties, instead behaving no differently than diversifiers. Furthermore, we show a significant influence of financial uncertainty on the interconnectedness between green cryptocurrencies and other assets, indicating heightened exposure during market turmoil. As a result, less emphasis on green cryptocurrencies portfolio weightings should be placed and greater emphasis on green bonds and gold at time of financial distress. Their limited risk-reducing potential should also be considered for regulatory frameworks. Additionally, we note the similarities between green cryptocurrencies and conventional counterparts, evidenced by their dynamic homogeneity with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting synchronization. Consequently, conventional cryptocurrencies could serve as proxies for green counterparts in portfolio management strategies. These findings contribute to the understanding of green cryptocurrency dynamics and have implications for investment decision-making and risk management strategies in sustainable finance.},

   abstract = {The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon footprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is scarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured, reported, and evaluated. In light of this, the paper aims to analyze the measurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets on Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and optimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first repository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This study seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators measure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects impact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several key findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon emissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on Hugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the main application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between carbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and ML application domains. These results highlight the need for software measurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient model development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue, two classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their carbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency. The aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and sustainable model development within the ML community.},

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.},

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy. We conclude by identifying the European Union as being especially well-placed to play a leading role in this policy response and provide 13 recommendations that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing its impact on the environment.},

   abstract = {This paper argues that the terms ‘Sustainable artificial intelligence (AI)’ in general and ‘Sustainability of AI’ in particular are overused to the extent that they have lost their meaning. The AI for (social) good movement is a manifestation of this trend in which almost any application used in the context of healthcare or agriculture can be classified as AI for good regardless of whether such applications have been evaluated from a broader perspective. In this paper, we aim to create a common understanding of what the ‘AI for Sustainability’ movement ought to mean. We distinguish between two possible AI for Sustainability applications, namely those that fulfill the necessary conditions and those that fulfill the sufficient conditions. The former are purely predictive systems that serve as information providers. The latter are directly involved in an activity that contributes to a sustainability goal. We argue that taking action is a key element in distinguishing between these two application groups, as inaction is the key bottleneck in effectively tackling climate change. Furthermore, we question how effective the use of AI applications can be for sustainability when the systems themselves are inherently unsustainable. Hence, AI for Sustainability should include both an action that contributes to a sustainable end goal as well as an investigation of the sustainability issues of the AI system itself. Following that, Sustainable AI research can be on a gradient: AI in an application domain, AI towards sustainability, and AI for Sustainability.},

Large amounts of data for training such models benefit the models' performance. However, the size of the data and models results in long training times and high energy consumption. While publishing source code allows for replicability, users need to repeat the expensive training process if models are not shared. The main goal of the study is to investigate if publications that trained language models for software engineering (SE) tasks share source code and trained artifacts. The second goal is to analyze the transparency on training energy usage. We perform a snowballing-based literature search to find publications on language models for source code, and analyze their reusability from a sustainability standpoint. From 494 unique publications, we identified 293 relevant publications that use language models to address code-related tasks. Among them, 27% (79 out of 293) make artifacts available for reuse. This can be in the form of tools or IDE plugins designed for specific tasks or task-agnostic models that can be fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks. Moreover, we collect insights on the hardware used for model training, as well as training time, which together determine the energy consumption of the development process. We find that there are deficiencies in the sharing of information and artifacts for current studies on source code models for software engineering tasks, with 40% of the surveyed papers not sharing source code or trained artifacts. We recommend the sharing of source code as well as trained artifacts, to enable sustainable reproducibility. Moreover, comprehensive information on training times and hardware configurations should be shared for transparency on a model's carbon footprint.},

However, as the smartphone and tablet revolution fuels a massive deployment of wireless networks, often in the form of WiFi hotspots, more and more attention is expected to be devoted to the energy-efficient management of wireless access infrastructure. These networks tend to be dense and over-provisioned, which in time leads to significant energy wastage in off-peak conditions. In this paper, we present MORFEO a flexible energy-saving decision algorithm to tune the energy consumption of a wireless infrastructure to the actual network conditions in terms of both user density and traffic patterns.

   abstract = {Sustainability is an increasingly-studied topic in software engineering in general, and in software architecture in particular. There are already a number of secondary studies addressing sustainability in software engineering, but no such study focusing explicitly on software architecture. This work aims to fill this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the intersection between sustainability and software architecture research with the intention of (i) reflecting on the current state of the art, and (ii) identifying the needs for further research. Our results show that, overall, existing works have focused disproportionately on specific aspects of sustainability, and in particular on the most technical and "inward facing" ones. This comes at the expense of the holistic perspective required to address a multi-faceted concern such as sustainability. Furthermore, more reflection-oriented research works, and better coverage of the activities in the architecting life cycle are required to further the maturity of the area. Based on our findings we then propose a research agenda for sustainability-aware software architecture.},

   abstract = {Background/Context : The objective of achieving higher sustainability in our lifestyles by information and communication technology has lead to a plethora of research activities in related fields. Consequently, Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S) has developed as an active area of research. Objective/Aim: Though SE4S gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions, there is only one rigorous survey of the field. We follow up on this systematic mapping study from 2012 with a more in-depth overview of the status of research, as most work has been conducted in the last 4 years. Method: The applied method is a systematic mapping study through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas are most explored, and which research type facets have been used, to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art in SE4S. Results: We contribute an overview of current research topics and trends, and their distribution according to the research type facet and the application domains. Furthermore, we aggregate the topics into clusters and list proposed and used methods, frameworks, and tools. Conclusion: The research map shows that impact currently is limited to few knowledge areas and there is need for a future roadmap to fill the gaps. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

We conducted a systematic mapping study, analyzed 55 publications, and identified 29 approaches that have been published since the year 2000. We analyzed how the approaches evolved over time and how the publications and authors are influenced by each other. Furthermore, the approaches are analyzed in terms of their supported requirements engineering activities, along with the evidence provided in the publications. Additionally, we also analyzed which sustainability definitions have been used, if an iterative application of the approaches is discussed, and if the approaches also provide a tool-support for practitioners. We noticed an increase of publications on requirements engineering approaches toward sustainability in the last years, whereas a majority discuss sustainability based on the same multi-dimensional concept. Although different case studies have been already conducted, we noticed a lack of an industrial application. Our main findings concern the need of an evaluation on how the proposed requirements engineering approaches can also be applied in agile software development processes. Additionally, we also promote the development of supporting software tools to support practitioners in adapting the proposed approaches.},

Consequently, research on ICT/digitization and their impact on environmental sustainability has witnessed exponential growth in the last few decades. This study provides a systematic review of the relationship between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability over the period from January 2000 to April 2022. It aimed to improve our understanding of the different theories and channels governing the ICT/digitization–environmental sustainability nexus, to provide an in-depth analysis and discussion of the trends and main empirical findings of the reviewed articles, and to highlight key avenues for future research. In total, 166 scientific articles examining 297 associations between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability were selected for this review. The results revealed that most of the studies have used measures based on climate change and air pollution for environmental sustainability, and traditional ICT/digitization measures, e.g., mobile phone subscriptions and internet users. The results also showed that although most studies found evidence for ICT/digitization improving environmental sustainability, evidence for a negative association is concentrated in studies on the ’Group of’ countries. The results also revealed a scarcity of studies investigating nonlinear relationships between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability.},

A complete conceptual view of the environmental impact of ICT can be described in three orders of effect: Direct, indirect and systemic. Objective: The goal of this study is to find out how the existing literature contributes towards our understanding of the environmental impact of ICT. We approach this question by identifying factors that can be of influence on the environmental impact and map these factors onto a conceptual framework of Green ICT. Method: We used a systematic literature review to collect factors of influence regarding the environmental impact of ICT. Results: From the data we collected and the analyses made, we created a taxonomy, and report on the frequencies of the factors of influence in the primary studies as well as gaps and additions compared to the conceptual framework. We found five main classes of influence that can form a continuous cycle, but noted that the research field is strongly focused on the direct impact of ICT. Conclusion: Our study contributes towards a better understanding of the environmental impact of ICT by framing factors of influence in a conceptual framework. The taxonomy we create and the analysis of the studies could be helpful in defining a research agenda, to further enable the full potential of Green ICT. In addition, the taxonomy can be used as a starting point for a practical tool, for organizations that wish to apply Green ICT to its full extent.},

Our analysis allowed us a detailed look at some of the ways in which metaphorical language opens dialogical space in the session to talk about the position of parentification of the client and about the price she has to pay for this position in terms of preoccupying worries and loneliness. Furthermore our analysis revealed the delicate dialogical nature of the therapeutic process in which, in talk, the therapist takes the client’s experiencing into account all the time.},

The surveys and theoretical frameworks that consider the environmental aspects of Green IT stand out. Among the empirical studies, investigations related to organizational motivations and the role of corporate social responsibility in the adoption of Green IT prevail. Behavioral factors linked to cognitive aspects that provide a preliminary view on the diffusion status and maturity of the Green IT also emerge among field studies. It should be noted that most studies were conducted in developed countries, that is, countries where technology is more widespread. Among the main managerial implications of the research, it was evident that the need for greater energy efficiency and, consequently, cost savings in IT operations, are the main factors for the adoption of Green IT.},

We are living in the Anthropocene, an era in which human activities in highly industrialized countries are responsible for overshooting several planetary boundaries, with poorer communities contributing least to the problems but being impacted the most. At the same time, technical and economic gains fail to provide society at large with equal opportunities and improved quality of life. This paper describes approaches taken in computing education to address the issue of sustainability. It presents results of a systematic review of literature on sustainability in computing education. From a set of 572 publications extracted from six large digital libraries plus snowballing, we distilled and analyzed the 90 relevant primary studies. Using an inductive and deductive thematic analysis, we study 1) conceptions of sustainability, computing, and education, 2) implementations of sustainability in computing education, and 3) research on sustainability in computing education. We present a framework capturing learning objectives and outcomes as well as pedagogical methods for sustainability in computing education. These results can be mapped to existing standards and curricula in future work. We find that only a few of the articles engage with the challenges as calling for drastic systemic change, along with radically new understandings of computing and education. We suggest that future research should connect to the substantial body of critical theory such as feminist theory of science and technology. Existing research on sustainability in computing education may be considered as rather immature as the majority of articles are experience reports with limited empirical research.},

Background Since sustainability became a challenge in software engineering, researchers mainly from requirements engineering and software architecture communities have contributed to defining the basis of the notion of sustainability-aware software. Problem Despite these valuable efforts, the assessment and design based on the notion of sustainability as a software quality is still poorly understood. There is no consensus on which sustainability requirements should be considered. Aim and Method To fill this gap, a survey was designed with a double objective: i) determine to which extent quality requirements contribute to the sustainability of software-intensive systems; and ii) identify direct dependencies among the sustainability dimensions. The survey involved different target audiences (e.g. software architects, ICT practitioners with expertise in Sustainability). We evaluated the perceived importance/relevance of each sustainability dimension, and the perceived usefulness of exploiting a sustainability model in different software engineering activities.

   abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of certain factors on electricity consumption in Spain at a sectoral level. An electricity consumption function has been estimated by using panel data, depending on gross value added (GVA), temperatures, capitalization , and human capital. This function is obtained for total productive electricity consumption and for the agricultural, construction, industrial, service, and public administration sectors, referring to the 17 Autonomous Communities of Spain for the 2000-2013 period. The obtained results show important sectoral differences in the effect that GVA has on electricity consumption, indicating a positive and increasing effect of temperatures above 22 °C in the total economy and in the tertiary sector, and a negative effect of temperatures below 18 °C in some sectors. These results may indicate that global warming may induce an electricity demand growth in Spain, especially related to cooling needs. The results also highlight the positive effects of capitalization in all sectors, and the negative effects of human capital, except for the public administration sector. In this context, it may be appropriate to carry out policies that mitigate this consumption growth, reinforcing energy efficiency measures, and human capital investments.},

   abstract = {The book series addresses novel techniques and measures related to sustainable energy developments with an interdisciplinary focus that cuts across all fields of science, engineering and technology linking renewable energy and other sustainable materials with human society. It addresses renewable energy sources and sustainable policy options, including energy efficiency and energy conservation to provide long-term solutions for key-problems of industrialized, developing and transition countries by fostering clean and domestically available energy and, concurrently, decreasing dependence on fossil fuel imports and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Possible applications will be addressed not only from a technical point of view, but also from economic, financial, social, political, legislative and regulatory viewpoints. The book series aims to become a state-of-the-art source for a large group of readers comprising different stakeholders and professionals, including government and non-governmental organizations and institutions, international funding agencies, universities, public health and energy institutions, and other relevant institutions. SERIES EDITOR: Jochen Bundschuh This book provides the connection between the growing body of literature on sustainability and the topics of energy and ICT. It aims to show how stakeholders active in this area need to play their part ensuring that the ICT-sector evolves towards a sector that can lead through "greening by IT" and also shows that it can "green its own IT" as well. This is the first book that integrates two seemingly incompatible approaches to sustainability: efficiency and effectiveness. The book builds on the efficiency initiatives already taken by industry, but it is not a "how-to-do-it manual". It offers insight in state of the art approaches to green IT and greening by IT. Attention to important stakeholders outside the sector, e.g. policy makers and the field of education, makes this book comprehensive. A more encompassing view on ICT and sustainability is offered to the reader and, as such, managers in higher education, educators, CIO's, policymakers and regulators are inspired to integrate their efforts and to contribute to a transition of one of the most important and prominent sectors in our global economy.},

   abstract = {The quantum advantage threshold determines when a quantum processing unit (QPU) is more efficient with respect to classical computing hardware in terms of algorithmic complexity. The ‘green’ quantum advantage threshold—based on a comparison of energetic efficiency between the two—is going to play a fundamental role in the comparison between quantum and classical hardware. Indeed, its characterization would enable better decisions on energy-saving strategies, e.g. for distributing the workload in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Here, we show that the green quantum advantage threshold crucially depends on (a) the quality of the experimental quantum gates and (b) the entanglement generated in the QPU. Indeed, for noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware and algorithms requiring a moderate amount of entanglement, a classical tensor network emulation can be more energy-efficient at equal final state fidelity than quantum computation. We compute the green quantum advantage threshold for a few paradigmatic examples in terms of algorithms and hardware platforms, and identify algorithms with a power-law decay of singular values of bipartitions—with power-law exponent α ≲ 1 —as the green quantum advantage threshold in the near future.},

   abstract = {Background: An increase in ICT devices and services has led to a rise in carbon emissions. As a result, there is a growing demand for energy-efficient software; however, this demand remains unmet due to the lack of knowledge regarding the best practices for reducing energy consumption in software. Unnecessary iterations and faulty looping conditions in different loops can consume high energy, and loops are considered as one of the most energy consuming entities. Aim: The purpose of this thesis is to detect and rectify energy code smells in different Java loop types by implementing static code analysis. Method: Using the DSR approach, a Java Maven custom SonarQube plugin was developed. The plugin underwent in-house testing as well as evaluation by professionals. The professionals had provided feedback, which were later analyzed by using a qualitative method. Results:For internal testing, 16 different open-source Java projects were selected. The results demonstrated considerable variations in the prevalence of energy code smells across the projects. Additionally, the plugin provided sample code suggestions to address each identified energy code smell. Finally, from the industry experts review, the plugin received an overall rating of Very Good. Conclusion: The plugin had successfully detected code smells and suggested code samples to rectify the detected code smells. However, it cannot be overlooked that the plugin may also generate false positives.},

   abstract = {Sustainability is a reality and a necessity for everyone in all areas. The changes that are taking place with respect to environmental sensitivity force organizations to adopt a new approach to this problem. This has led organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)to develop standards that help all types of organizations achieve sustainable development, such as the ISO 14000 family of standards. However, the ISO 14000 family of standards is too generic and does not address specific areas that are highly relevant for organizations in the search for sustainability, as is the case of the area of Information Technology (IT). From the area of IT, sustainability and, in particular, the Green IT philosophy have become slogans for executive, corporate, and service management. Implementing Green IT initiatives has become a priority for the environmental awareness of organizations that want to stay ahead of the curve. That is why, in this study, the application/inclusion of the ISO 14000 family of standards to IT is carried out. The results obtained and the validation of this proposal by experts show an adequate and consistent proposal, which covers all areas related to IT. All this demonstrates the applicability of the ISO 14000 family of standards to IT through the Green IT and completes a developed framework that is useful in practice when implementing the governance and management of Green IT. Likewise, thanks to this proposal, organizations finally have a standardized guide when implementing Green IT, as well as when seeking for international and recognized certifications in this field.},

   abstract = {Context: The energy efficiency of IT systems, also referred to as Green IT, is attracting more and more attention. While several researchers have focused on the energy efficiency of hardware and embedded systems, the role of application software in IT energy consumption still needs investigation. Objective: This paper aims to define a methodology for measuring software energy efficiency and to understand the consequences of abstraction layers and application development environments for the energy efficiency of software applications. Method: We first develop a measure of energy efficiency that is appropriate for software applications. We then examine how the use of application development environments relates to this measure of energy efficiency for a sample of 63 open source software applications. Results: Our findings indicate that a greater use of application development environments - specifically, frameworks and external libraries - is more detrimental in terms of energy efficiency for larger applications than for smaller applications. We also find that different functional application types have distinctly different levels of energy efficiency, with text and image editing and gaming applications being the most energy inefficient due to their intense use of the processor. Conclusion: We conclude that different designs can have a significant impact on the energy efficiency of software applications. We have related the use of software application development environments to software energy efficiency suggesting that there may be a trade-off between development efficiency and energy efficiency. We propose new research to further investigate this topic. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Despite of the numerous metrics to evaluate software performance, the study on how to evaluate software energy efficiency is still in its early stage. In this paper, we propose the Greenup, Powerup, and Speedup metrics (GPS-UP) to categorize software implementation and optimization efficiency. The GPSUP metrics transform the performance, power and energy of a program into a point on the GPS-UP software energy efficiency quadrant graph. We present eight categories of possible scenarios of software optimization, with examples on how to obtain them. Four categories are green (save energy), and four are red (waste energy). Moreover, we compare our metrics to existing metrics such as Energy Delay Product (EDP).},

   abstract = {Energy efficiency is increasingly important for future information and communication technologies (ICT), because the increased usage of ICT, together with increasing energy costs and the need to reduce green house gas emissions call for energy-efficient technologies that decrease the overall energy consumption of computation, storage and communications. Cloud computing has recently received considerable attention, as a promising approach for delivering ICT services by improving the utilization of data centre resources. In principle, cloud computing can be an inherently energy-efficient technology for ICT provided that its potential for significant energy savings that have so far focused on hardware aspects, can be fully explored with respect to system operation and networking aspects. Thus this paper, in the context of cloud computing, reviews the usage of methods and technologies currently used for energy-efficient operation of computer hardware and network infrastructure.After surveying some of the current best practice and relevant literature in this area, this paper identifies some of the remaining key research challenges that arise when such energy-saving techniques are extended for use in cloud computing environments.},

The GPSUP metrics transform the performance, power and energy of a program into a point on the GPS-UP software energy efficiency quadrant graph. We present eight categories of possible scenarios of software optimization, with examples on how to obtain them. Four categories are green (save energy), and four are red (waste energy).

This computational stockpile represents a substantial wasted potential: modern smartphones have increasingly high-performance and energy-efficient processors, extensive networking capabilities, and a reliable built-in power supply. This project studies the ability to reuse smartphones as "junkyard computers."Junkyard computers grow global computing capacity by extending device lifetimes, which supplants the manufacture of new devices. We show that the capabilities of even decade-old smartphones are within those demanded by modern cloud microservices and discuss how to combine phones to perform increasingly complex tasks. We describe how current operation-focused metrics do not capture the actual carbon costs of compute. We propose Computational Carbon Intensity - -a performance metric that balances the continued service of older devices with the superlinear runtime improvements of newer machines. We use this metric to redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones. We analyze the carbon benefits of deploying large, end-to-end microservice-based applications on these smartphones. Finally, we describe system architectures and associated challenges to scale to cloudlets with hundreds and thousands of smartphones.},

Thus, identifying efficient configurations proves challenging. This paper presents Polar, an approach for the automated determination of energy-efficient configurations, as well as an implementation for Linux. Polar combines application profiles and system-level information to select efficient configurations dynamically and does not require application changes.

Goal: Given that energy efficiency for IT systems is a rising concern, we investigate existing work in the area of energy-aware software development and identify open research challenges. Our goal is to reveal limitations, features, and tradeoffs regarding energy-performance for software development and provide insights on existing approaches, tools, and techniques for energy-efficient programming. Method: We analyze and categorize research work mostly extracted from top-tier conferences and journals concerning energy efficiency across the software development lifecycle phases. Results: Our analysis shows that related work in this area has focused mainly on the implementation and verification phases of the software development lifecycle. Existing work shows that the use of parallel and approximate programming, source code analyzers, efficient data structures, coding practices, and specific programming languages can significantly increase energy efficiency. Moreover, the utilization of energy monitoring tools and benchmarks can provide insights for the software practitioners and raise energy-awareness during the development phase.},
