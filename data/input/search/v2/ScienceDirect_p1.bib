abstract = {One of the key requirements of a sustainable city is the efficiency of the underlying technologies implemented for the provision of services to its residents. Cloud Computing is one such technology that offers a variety of applications support for sustainable cities such as infrastructure for processing of big data and provision of real time services to end users. However, power management of cloud computing infrastructure (data centers) becomes a challenging issue for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), having negative financial, environmental and sustainability implications. To process the user requests (incoming workload), the data centers (DCs) incur huge energy (electricity) bills. Current studies indicate the workload allocation strategies among geographical distributed DCs mostly focus on using renewable energy and cheaper rates of electricity to reduce the overall energy costs. In this paper, we explore the energy cost minimization problem for geo-distributed DCs considering call option in electricity derivative market under time-varying system dynamics. A call option is an agreement between CSPs and electricity supplier, which gives the rights (not obligation) to option holder to purchase a specific amount of electricity over a time period at a predefined fixed price. To minimize the energy cost, we propose an online algorithm for interactive workload distribution called option pricing based geographical load balancing (OptionGLB). Experimental evaluation based on real-world data indicates the efficacy of OptionGLB over current workload allocation strategies.}

However, the application of deep learning models in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to detect plant diseases is hindered by their computational complexity and the lack of public datasets and information in this field. In this paper, we have two objectives. Firstly, we present a cloud-based collection by compiling and analyzing 38 available public datasets, which simplifies the work of researchers by reducing the time spent searching for suitable datasets. Secondly, we propose a lightweight model named Tiny-LeViT based on the transformer architecture for efficient leaf disease classification in edge network contexts. Our experiments on five popular datasets show that the proposed model outperforms its competitors, achieving at least 9% higher frame rate while retaining comparable F1-scores with an average of 97.25% on both RTX workstation and edge devices.}

To address this gap, our study analyzes the economy-wide impacts of renewable energy expansion policies in Korea, with a specific focus on financing mechanisms. We employ a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model that considers imperfections in labor markets, heterogeneous households, and various electricity generation technologies. Our analysis examines the effects of various financing options for renewable energy on economic growth, the labor market, and social welfare, both with and without emission regulations. Our results reveal a trade-off between efficiency and equality when it comes to financing renewable energy expansion. Specifically, we find that financing the expansion through a lump-sum tax is the most efficient option, resulting in the smallest reduction in GDP compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, this option also has the greatest negative impact on income inequality, as it leads to an increase in skill premiums and capital prices, exacerbating income disparities between households. Our findings suggest that renewable energy expansion tends to be regressive, with low-income households bearing a relatively larger burden of the costs associated with the expansion. Policymakers need to consider a range of options for alleviating income inequality and labor market disparity, such as targeted subsidies or transfers, to ensure a fair and efficient transition to a sustainable energy system.}

Slaughterhouse wastes present a promising opportunity to partially reduce reliance on fossil-based energy. Biogas technology is regarded as one of the methods used in Ghana and can be used to combat climate change, while meeting demand for energy in the country. The objective of the research seeks to theoretically estimate biogas production potential from livestock and slaughterhouse wastes in Ghana, in order for policymakers to consider biogas technology as a potential source of renewable energy to meet the country's energy demand, while contributing to the SDG goals. This study obtained livestock population data from the Ministry of Food & Agriculture and the Ministry of Fisheries & Livestock from 2010 to 2020, and estimated the livestock waste production from slaughterhouses, biogas generation capacity, electricity production potential, greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential and biofertilizer generation capacity of Ghana in the fiscal year 2020. The findings indicated that, in the year 2020, slaughterhouses in Ghana generated 4.205 × 1010 kg of waste which can be used to produce 6.792 × 109 m3 of biogas, electricity generation rate of 7.110 × 109 kwh/year which represents about 43.01% of the total electricity consumed in the country that year. Also, the amount of GHG (CO2) emissions by using methane from the AD is 3.631 × 109 kgCO2. The avoided GHG emissions estimated is 1.075 × 1010 kg and biofertilizer of 4.514 × 108 kg can be produced.}

In our research, is introduced a base technology called Cloud Computing (CC) to operate with the Big Data (BD). CC is a technology which refers to the processing power of data in the fog, providing more “green” computational and sustainable computing. Since it is a recently investigated technology, it has many gaps in security and privacy. So, in this paper, we proposed a new system for Cloud Computing integrated with Internet of Things as a base scenario for Big Data. Moreover, we tried to establish an architecture relaying on the security of the network in order to improve the security issues. A solution proposed is installing a security “wall” between the Cloud Server and the Internet, with the aim to eliminate the privacy and security issues. As a result, we consider that CC deals more efficient with the privacy issue of bits transferred through time. Through our proposed system, the interaction and cooperation between things and objects communicate through the wireless networks in order to fulfil the objective set to them as a combined entity. Regarding the major goal of our research, which is the security, a sort survey of IoT and CC presented, with a focus on the security issues of both technologies. In addition to this, we try present the security challenges of the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing with the aim to provide an architecture relaying on the security of the network in order to improve their security issues. Finally, we realize that through our study Cloud Computing could offer a more “green” and efficient fog environment for sustainable computing scenarios.}

Green IoT applications based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed in various domains, such as medical, engineering, industry, and smart cities to grow the production. To increase the performance of sustainable cities, communicating nodes are interconnected autonomously to observe the environment, where they need to be more energy-efficient. Edge computing operates in a distributed manner and improves the response time with the least latency through various edge servers. Although the integration of edge computing and Green IoT significantly improves the network performance in terms of computation and data storage, low powered sensors have constraints in terms of battery power, low transmission range, and security aspects. Therefore, adopting an emerging solution is needed to offer energy services with secure data delivery for sustainable cities. This paper presents an intelligent and secure edge-enabled computing (ISEC) model for sustainable cities using Green IoT, which aims to develop the communication strategy with decreasing the liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transportation. The proposed model generates optimal features using deep learning for data routing, which may help to train the sensors for predicting the finest routes toward edge servers. Moreover, the integration of distributed hashing with chaining strategy eases security solutions with efficient computing system. The experimental results reveal the improved performance of the proposed ISEC model against other solutions for energy consumption by 21 %, network throughput by 15 %, end-to-end delay by 12 %, route interruption by 36 %, and network overhead by 52 %.}

Data exchange and sharing are confidential for administering user security and privacy. The need for confidentiality is one of the significant obstacles to ubiquitous computing areas like human–machine interfaces and data security. It is crucial in ubiquitous computing to protect user and system security, privacy, and safety. Hence, this article introduces a Linearized Mutual Security Scheme (LMSS) to prevent data leakage and security breaches. The scheme provides mutual authentication based on security requirements depending upon the ubiquitous application. The user credentials are pre-shared with the service providers for determining the security level and certificate sharing. This sharing is updated at fixed intervals for deciding on authentication revocation and strength updates. In this scheme, federated learning is exploited for identifying user security demands and levels administered by different users. Based on the learning recommendations, the key authentication factors are updated in the certificate, preventing anonymous and tracking sessions in the sharing interval. Therefore, the proposed scheme achieves fair anomaly detection of 14.47%, reduces data leakage rate by 13.68%, and halts sessions by 10.26%. Besides, it improves the sharing ratio of 6.92% and application responses.}

Moreover, an approach for migrations among datacenters based on an expert system has been tested in several scenarios with renewable energy dynamically available.

Consequently, the present research aims to assess the factors that impact the integration of cloud computing within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and its subsequent effects on environmental, financial, and social performance. The data were collected from 415 SMEs and were analyzed using a hybrid SEM-ANN approach. PLS-SEM results indicate that relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, top management support, cost reduction, and government support significantly affect cloud computing integration. This study also empirically demonstrated that SMEs could improve their financial, environmental, and social performance by integrating cloud computing services. ANN results show that complexity, with a normalized importance (NI) of 89.14%, is ranked the first among other factors affecting cloud computing integration in SMEs. This is followed by cost reduction (NI = 82.67%), government support (NI = 73.37%), compatibility (NI = 70.02%), top management support (NI = 52.43%), and relative advantage (NI = 48.72%). Theoretically, this study goes beyond examining the determinants affecting cloud computing integration by examining their impact on SMEs’ environmental, financial, and social performance in a comprehensive manner.

In this article we combine an analysis of accountability arrangements in software engineering and a model of sustainability transformations to trace how certain dynamics are starting to make software engineering accountable for sustainability in the technological, cultural, economic and governance domains. The article discusses existing approaches for sustainable software engineering and software engineering for sustainability, traces emerging discourses that connect digitalization and sustainability, highlights new digital business models that may support sustainability and shows governance efforts to highlight “green and digital” policy problems. Yet, we argue that these are so far niche dynamics and that a sustainability transformation requires a collective and long-lasting effort to engender systemic changes. The goal should be to create varied accountability arrangements for sustainability in software engineering which is embedded in complex ways in society and economy.}

In this ongoing analysis, Delphi was used to filter the most crucial ones from a list of 18 identified parameters, whereas, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the relevance of each parameter. Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) were further applied to identify the cause-effect relationship and to construct the hierarchical interrelationships among the parameters. Finally, to identify the driving and dependence parameters, Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) approach was used. The findings revealed that the most crucial elements in building a sustainable AI cloud system were technological, financial, and environmental concerns. More particularly, from all perspectives, digitalization is deemed to be the most critical within the group, with the greatest priority degree and significant driving as well as dependent tendency. According to ISM and MICMAC, user tendency to learn and R&D sector collaboration seems to be the most dependent and the independent factors respectively among the group. Remaining of the 13 factors are interrelated and operates as linkage obstacles. This study provides useful insights for IT firms trying to implement sustainable AI cloud systems and underlines the importance of including environmental and economic concerns into decision-making processes.}

abstract = {The worldwide adoption of cloud data centers (CDCs) has given rise to the ubiquitous demand for hosting application services on the cloud. Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and generating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical cloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit and the COSCO framework show that HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption, SLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54 and 3 percent respectively.}

First, seven different criteria are defined with supported literature. After that, these factors are weighted by considering decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology based on 2-tuple hesitant interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (HIVPFs). Furthermore, different pricing strategies are also ranked by using HIVPF technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). Also, a sensitivity analysis is also performed by considering six different conditions. The main contribution of this study is proposing a new mathematical model to solve a significant problem regarding energy prices. It is concluded that the results of both TOPSIS and VIKOR are quite similar. On the other side, it is also understood that the results of six different cases are almost the same. This situation explains that analysis results are reliable and coherent. The findings indicate that safety incidence and waste management are the most crucial factors for the sustainability of the energy price. In addition, skimming is the best pricing strategy for the energy industry. Within this framework, energy companies should firstly offer high prices to the market. After that, the price should be reduced when there is a decrease in the demand.}

In this study we explore the effect ambitious policies for resource efficiency and greenhouse gas abatement would have on West Asian economies and what their contribution to environmental sustainability could look like. We employ the Global Trade and Environmental Resource Model (GTEM-Resource) to empirically assess the economic and environmental implications of global policy initiatives in the region. Results show that resource efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement policies are complementary in their effects. Resource efficiency policies boost resource use productivity in the region, reduce all categories of material extraction based on sustainable consumption and production behaviour and also caused by trade, and foster economic performance. By contrast, GHG emission abatement policies have a small effect on resource productivity but drive significant GHG reductions that are accompanied by reduced economic performance. When these two policies are combined, real GDP in West Asia is projected to increase by 8% relative to business-as-usual by 2060, while resource extraction and GHG emissions levels in the region would decline dramatically by 40% and 50%, respectively. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would be much better off, compared to other countries in the region, with large increases in real GDP and major reductions in GHG emissions and resource extraction levels. Findings suggest that technology development and climate mitigation policies would result in a win-win solution for all countries in West Asia, contributing to maintaining well-being and protecting the environment on regional and global scales. This shows that there is a pathway to economic prosperity for resource-rich countries and regions.}

VCC offers vehicle-to-device, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication in which the vehicles can communicate using sensing abilities. VCC is exploiting the IoT environment, cloud architecture, and vehicle resources. However, the energy-efficient privacy of communicators and security of communication are assertive problems in VCC. To accomplish this goal, we present an identity-based authentication scheme for VCC which also uses radio frequency identification (RFID). The security and robustness of the devised scheme are evaluated using informal and formal analysis. The informal analysis shows that our scheme is vigorous to resist various attacks. The formal analysis is done through Random Oracle Model (ROM) which shows that the scheme is secure and efficient. The performance of our scheme is also determined and compared with various related schemes which clearly illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Thus, our scheme is very efficient for employment in the VCC environment.}

Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize various domains of science and engineering, including macro-energy systems and sustainable energy materials design. Conventional approaches for renewable and sustainable energy systems solely rely on classical computing techniques that may not scale well with the increasing size and complexity of applications. Owing to the advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms, QC and quantum artificial intelligence make promising tools to handle renewable and sustainable energy systems even at larger scales. In this review, we discuss the prospects of QC for various areas of applications in energy sustainability to help address climate change. In addition to providing a brief background on the operations of quantum computers, the constituent segments of widely adopted QC-based techniques that improve the computational efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for sustainable energy materials along with quantum artificial intelligence methods that can address complex optimization and machine learning problems arising in renewable energy systems are also introduced in this paper. We screen the presented quantum algorithms based on their performance on current quantum devices despite their promising potential.

A research gap was identified in the literature concerning the study of the amount of energy that these systems need for their operation, and the energy efficiency that may be attained depending on their design. After the selection of five representative personal health records, a total of 20 tasks commonly done, and based on previous work, were performed with regard to two proposed scenarios, namely patient use and health personnel usage. The power consumption of the main components of a host machine was measured during the performance of the proposed duties. To that end, a hardware tool called the Energy Efficiency Tester was employed. The data collected were analyzed statistically, and significant differences were found in the respective consumption of the display (χ2 (4) = 23.782, p = 0.000), the processor (χ2 (4) = 29.018, p = 0.000) and the whole PC (χ2 (4) = 28.582, p = 0.000). For all of these components, NoMoreClipBoard was the personal health record that required the least energy (57.699 W for the display, 3.162 W for the processor and 181.113 W for the whole PC). A total of two strong correlations were found in the energy consumption between the hard disk and the graphics card (r = 0.791, p < 0.001), and the processor and the PC (r = 0.950, p < 0.001). Some features generated special amounts of power consumption, such as the news wall found on PatientsLikeMe, or the use of load icons that had an impact on most PC components. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the user interfaces was performed. A discussion was carried out on the design of the user interfaces, also taking into account recommendations drawn from the literature, checking for their implementation in the personal health records selected. With the aim of promoting sustainability among software developers, a best practice guideline on sustainable software design was proposed.

The advent of generation mobile systems, the so-called 5 G in the early century, has realized this dream. 5 G can provide network services with extremely-high throughput and extremely-low delay and allows a huge device number to connect based on Internet infrastructure, forming the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has been applied in various fields serving humanity, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, education, military, and IoT ecosystems. One of the main challenges of IoT applications is computing solutions to reduce service response times. This study proposes an efficient edge computing management mechanism for IoT applications in smart cities. Our mechanism proposes a small database (called an information map) that allows edge computing servers of smart cities to store edge service information. When the mobile end-users move to the new edge server' managed coverage, properties related to the EC service are exchanged between the edge servers. The experiment results have shown that our proposed mechanism improves service response time and energy consumption many times compared to the traditional mechanism. We hope that this mechanism will be strongly applied to sustainable smart cities in the future.}

This in turn has led to the generation of massive volumes of data that needs to be transmitted, processed and stored for efficient interpretation and utilization. Edge computing has emerged as a viable solution which complements cloud thereby enabling the integrated edge–cloud paradigm to successfully satisfy the design requirements of IoT applications. A vast majority of existing studies have proposed scheduling frameworks for individual tasks and only very few works have considered the more challenging problem of scheduling complex workloads such as workflows across edge–cloud environments. Workflow scheduling is an NP hard problem in distributed infrastructures. It is further complicated when scheduling framework needs to coordinate workflow executions across resource constrained and highly distributed edge–cloud environments. In this work, we leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning for designing a workflow scheduling framework capable of overcoming the aforementioned challenges. Different from all existing works we have designed a novel hierarchical action space for promoting a clear distinction between edge and cloud nodes. Coupled with this a hybrid actor–critic based scheduling framework enhanced with proximal policy optimization technique is proposed to efficiently deal with the complex workflow scheduling problem in edge–cloud environments. Performance of the proposed framework was compared against several baseline algorithms using energy consumption, execution time, percentage of deadline hits and percentage of jobs completed as evaluation metrics. Proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning technique performed 56% better with respect to energy consumption and 46% with respect to execution time compared to time and energy optimized baselines, respectively. This was achieved while also maintaining the energy efficiency in par with the energy optimized baseline and execution time in par with the time optimized baseline. The results thus demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique in establishing the best-trade off between the conflicting goals of minimizing energy consumption and execution time.}

The design of the sustainable cloud storage auditing protocol is an attractive research filed in the security community. As we all know, secret keys of the data storage auditing in the cloud system are very sensitive. To enhance the security of the cloud data storage auditing, some studies focused on the research of key updates. In this paper, we propose a secure sustainable storage auditing protocol that can support key updates for clients in cloud computing. In order to alleviate the high overhead of key updates at the local side, the partial key update tasks are outsourced to the TPA. Moreover, clients can verify the validity of the new updated keys by using the technology of the BLS signature. The security analysis shows that the proposed protocol can provide the security properties of the correctness, the verifiability and the accountability. Compared to previous studies, the proposed protocol is more efficient which is very suitable for the real-world sustainable cloud storage auditing.}

However, scheduling workflows and allocating resources is a difficult task due to factors such as task dependency, heterogeneity, and computational intensity. Resource allocation can pose significant challenges in terms of execution time and cost. As a result, there is a need to reduce energy consumption, makespan, and cost simultaneously, which is often framed as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient RL-based workflow scheduling framework for cloud computing. The framework integrates the X-NOR Whirlpool hashing algorithm to enhance security by allowing legitimate users into the cloud environment. The Linearly Weighted Moving Average - Sea Lion Optimization method is used to compute minimal parameters, the Jordan Normal Form - Deep Kronecker Neural Network is utilized for resource monitoring, and the Fuzzy Self-Defense algorithm is employed for efficient selection of virtual machines.

MCC's use may be restricted because of increasing energy utilization and restricted access to energy supplies. This challenge may be tackled using the green approach, which entails the development of several algorithms or approaches to attain the highest possible degree of service quality. Several techniques in this idea allow consumers to offload data processing and storage to cloud-based servers to reduce the energy utilization of mobile nodes. Offloading is an essential element that helps MCC reduce task load and optimize data storage utilizing a cloud resource pool. Regarding the advantages of the offloading procedure, issues such as reliability (node failure), energy efficiency (energy consumption, task processing), and time management (execution time and task deadline) must be handled. This work presents a unique offloading approach in green MCC depending on a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm because of the NP-Hard nature of the issue. The African Wild Dog Algorithm (AWDA) and the cellular learning automata technique are merged to generate better responses. AWDA is based on the cooperative hunting behavior of African wild dogs. The quantity of cooperative hunters determines the efficacy of hunting. The optimization procedure is analogous to this collective hunting behavior. Furthermore, a learning automaton in the cellular learning automata technique describes each of these components. An element's learning automaton seeks to discover which action best complements its surrounding components. The simulation findings illustrated that the suggested hybrid technique outperforms the other algorithms regarding energy consumption, delay time, and cost. The proposed algorithm has improved the delay time, cost, and energy metric by 0.43%, 3.17%, and 8.37%, compared to other algorithms.}

abstract = {Background/Purpose
“Pan-scanning” pediatric blunt trauma patients leads to exposure to harmful radiation and increased healthcare costs without improving outcomes. We aimed to reduce computed tomography (CT) scans that are not indicated (NI) by imaging guidelines for injured children.
Methods
In July 2017, our Pediatric Trauma Center prospectively implemented validated imaging guidelines to direct CT imaging for trauma activations and consultations for children younger than 16 years old with blunt traumatic injuries. Patients with suspected physical abuse, CT imaging prior to arrival, penetrating mechanism, and instability precluding CT imaging were excluded. We compared CT scanning rates for pre-implementation (01/2016–06/2017) and post-implementation (07/2017–08/2021) time periods. Guideline compliance was evaluated by chart review and sustained through iterative process improvement cycles.
Results
During the pre-implementation era, 61 patients underwent 171 CT scans of which 87 (51%) scans were not indicated by guidelines. Post-implementation, 363 patients had 531 scans and only 134 (25%) CTs were not indicated. Total CTs performed declined after initiation of guidelines (2.80 vs 1.46 scans/patient, p<0.0001). Total NI CTs declined (1.41 vs 0.37 NI scans/patient, p<0.0001) reflected in significant reductions in all anatomic regions: head, cervical spine, chest, and abdomen/pelvis. Charges related to NI scans decreased from $1,490.31/patient to $408.21/patient, saving $218,000 in charges. Based on prior utilization, 146 children were spared excessive radiation with no clinically significant missed injuries since guideline implementation.
Conclusions
Quality improvement and implementation science methodologies to enhance compliance with imaging guidelines for children with blunt injuries can significantly reduce unnecessary CT scanning without compromising care. This practice reduces harmful radiation exposure in a sensitive patient population and may save healthcare systems money and resources.}

abstract = {Cloud-RAN is a key 5G enabler; it centralizes the baseband processing of several base stations by executing the baseband functions in a centralized, virtualized, and shared entity known as the Base Band Unit (BBU)-Pool. Cloud-RAN paves the way for joint management of the radio and computing resources of multiple base stations. In fact, centralization and virtualization allow for decreasing energy consumption which decreases Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX). Cloud-RAN architecture permits jointly allocating the radio and computing resources of multiple base stations. The radio resources include the Resource Blocks (RBs), the transmission power, and the Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS), whereas the computing resources include the CPUs resources. This paper investigates the potential benefits that could be scored thanks to the joint allocation of these two types of resources, with respect to energy consumption and overall throughput, when radio resources are finite and computing resources are not. The latter is an effect of the C-RAN architecture, which allows scalability and fast computing resource provisioning. Due to the unconstrained availability of computing resources, the joint allocation of radio and computing resources has a negligible impact when the objective is throughput maximization. However, it is highly beneficial when the target is energy consumption minimization in comparison to the sequential allocation that consists of allocating radio resources first, and then computing resources are allocated. For that, we formulate a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem having the objective of minimizing energy consumption. When the goal is to minimize energy consumption, the joint allocation of radio and computing resources reduces the total energy consumption by up to 21.3% when compared to the case where radio and computing resources in the BBU pool are allocated sequentially. Furthermore, given the NP-hardness of solving a MILP problem, we propose a two-step low-complexity matching game-based algorithm with a transmission power adjustment mechanism that aims at performing close to the MILP solver. The results show that our proposed matching game algorithm is a good alternative for solving the joint-allocation MILP problem, producing results that are very close to the MILP optimal solutions.}

abstract = {The expansion of online services, the advent of big data, and the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology have led to an exponential growth in the number of data centers (DC). Within this new digital systems, DCs are the keystone. This poses major environmental problems through high energy consumption. The energy consumption growth of the DC’s systems are expected to account for 3.2% of global carbon emissions by 2025. This remarkable growth in the energy consumption of DCs represents today a major challenge for energy efficiency. To meet these challenges, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) can be used to measure and optimize DC energy efficiency. Thus, accurate PUE prediction is challenging. Moreover, the non-linearity of the different DCs subsystems interactions and their inter-dependencies make the prediction of PUE more difficult since it is affected by complex factors such as workload variation, in addition to weather conditions and humidity, etc. In this paper, we present three machine learning models, MLP, Resilient Backpropagation-based DNN and Attention-based LSTM, to predict PUE values. The performance of these models has been evaluated using two datasets gathered from two case studies of real DCs. For both DC cases, experimental results showed that the attention-based LSTM model outperforms resilient backpropagation-based DNN and MLP models in terms of prediction errors and PUE.}

abstract = {Context:
Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which are challenging to maintain, and evolve in response to changes in stakeholder requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Objective:
The objective of the paper is to re-examine our previous assumptions and arguments in light of advances in the field. This reflection paper provides an opportunity to obtain new insights into the trends in software sustainability in both academia and industry, from a software architecture perspective specifically and software engineering more broadly. Given advances in research in the field, the increasing introduction of academic courses on different sustainability topics, and the engagement of companies to cope with sustainability goals, we reflect on advances and maturity about the role sustainability in general plays in today’s society. More specifically, we revisit the trends, open issues and research challenges identified five years ago in our previous paper on software sustainability research and practice from a software architecture viewpoint, which aimed to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures in order to consider how this paper influenced and motivated research in the intervening years.
Method:
The forward snowballing method was used to establish the methodological basis for our reflection on the state of the art. A total of 234 studies were identified between April 2018 and June 2023 and 102 studies were found to be relevant according to the selection criteria. A further subset was mapped to the primary themes of the original paper including definitions and concepts, reference architectures, measures and metrics, and education.
Vision:
The vision of this reflection paper is to provide a new foundation and road map of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software engineering highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.}

We propose a multi-step resource provision algorithm to address this issue efficiently. The forwarding step unites the iterative search for critical paths and the priority selection for task layers to reduce the makespan and reach an optimal critical task placement. The backward step trains processing servers against different loads using eclectic utilization levels to guarantee those servers function at their most efficient utilization values. Furthermore, this step optimizes energy consumption and resource diffusion by reallocating the existent VMs and mitigating an attempted overload of machines. Different evaluation metrics are assessed with respect to the number of tasks and VMs. The results show that the proposed paradigm optimizes energy consumption and resource utilization efficiently, lowering the makespan, overhead time, and network utilization and maximizing the throughput productivity and QoS satisfaction.}

abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) revolution has emerged as a promising network that enhanced information dissemination about the city's resources. This city's resources are wirelessly connected to different constrained devices (such as sensors, robotics, and actuators). However, the communication of this wireless information is threatened by several malicious attacks, cyber-attacks, and hackers. This is due to unsecured IIoT networks that were exposed as a potential back door entry point for the attacks. Consequently, this study aims to develop a security framework for the smart cities’ sustainability edge computing vulnerabilities using Petri Net and Genetic Algorithm-Based Reinforcement Learning (GARL). First, a common trust model for addressing information outflows in the network using a distributed authorization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is implemented on a secure framework modeling in Petri Net called secure trust-aware philosopher privacy and authentication (STAPPA) for mitigation of the privacy breach in the networks. Genetic Algorithm-based Reinforcement Learning (GARL) is used to optimize the search, detect anomalies, and shortest route during the agent learning in the environment. The detection and accuracy rate results obtained over a secure framework using reinforcement learning are 98.75, 99, 99.50, 99.75, and 100% during simulation in the network environment. The average sensitivity of the detection rate is 1.000, while the average specificity outcome is 0.868. The result of the GARL simulation model obtained shows the best distance of 238.84 * 10−3 fitness when the search space is optimized by reducing the number of chromosomes to 10 in the model. These approaches help to detect anomalies and prevent unauthorized users from accessing edge computing components in the city architecture.}

On the other hand, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of these ecosystems has increased considerably. Thus, it is necessary to apply policies and techniques to maximize sustainability within these ecosystems. Some of these policies and techniques are those based on artificial intelligence. However, the current processing of these policies and techniques can also consume a lot of resources. From this perspective, this article aims to clarify whether the sustainability of cloud/fog/edge/IoT ecosystems is improved by the application of artificial intelligence.

Assessing the benefit of using a particular cloud service, especially if such a service is being offered by providers that may be new to the cloud marketplace, remains a challenge. Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) provides a certification approach that associates a ranking to providers based on their capability assessment using a “cloud control matrix”. A provider can make a self-assessment, or an assessment can be undertaken by a third party. The intention is to increase user trust in a provider based on their rating using this methodology. This work investigates whether a similar certification methodology can be applied to edge resources, especially if these edge resources are combined with cloud services in a “smart cities” context. Can a CSA-like approach also be used to increase trust in use of edge resources? How would the CSA methodology need to change to support this type of assessment, and how useful is such an approach likely to be in practice? We propose a risk assessment methodology that can be used to address these concerns, and evaluate it in a practical application using both edge and cloud computing resources.}

abstract = {Many authors have proposed criteria to assess the “environmental friendliness” or “sustainability” of software products. However, a causal model that links observable properties of a software product to conditions of it being green or (more general) sustainable is still missing. Such a causal model is necessary because software products are intangible goods and, as such, only have indirect effects on the physical world. In particular, software products are not subject to any wear and tear, they can be copied without great effort, and generate no waste or emissions when being disposed of. Viewed in isolation, software seems to be a perfectly sustainable type of product. In real life, however, software products with the same or similar functionality can differ substantially in the burden they place on natural resources, especially if the sequence of released versions and resulting hardware obsolescence is taken into account. In this article, we present a model describing the causal chains from software products to their impacts on natural resources, including energy sources, from a life-cycle perspective. We focus on (i) the demands of software for hardware capacities (local, remote, and in the connecting network) and the resulting hardware energy demand, (ii) the expectations of users regarding such demands and how these affect hardware operating life, and (iii) the autonomy of users in managing their software use with regard to resource efficiency. We propose a hierarchical set of criteria and indicators to assess these impacts. We demonstrate the application of this set of criteria, including the definition of standard usage scenarios for chosen categories of software products. We further discuss the practicability of this type of assessment, its acceptability for several stakeholders and potential consequences for the eco-labeling of software products and sustainable software design.}

abstract = {Cloud computing is being rapidly adopted for managing IT services as a notable solution due to diverse beneficiaries such as automatically optimized resource management as well as modern service delivery models. The container as a service has been recently introduced by cloud providers as a new service apart from traditional cloud services. Containers enable applications to run and deploy on isolated virtual space, and the operating system kernel is shared among them. Also, containerization has some attributes such as scalability, highly portable properties, and lightweight, for those reasons, it is applied for running isolated applications. Reducing energy consumption, as well as their CO2 emissions, are great deals for cloud providers. In this direction, consolidation is recommended as a vital energy-aware approach in cloud data centers. Previously, independent virtual machine migration or container migration was proposed in the literature for green computing in cloud data centers. However, this paper proposes a new cloud resource management procedure based on a multi-criteria decision-making method that takes advantage of a joint virtual machine and container migration approach concurrently. The results of simulations using ContainerCloudsim simulator validates the applicability of the proposed approach which shows notable reductions in energy consumption, SLA violation, and number of migrations in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

Actually, in most scenarios, it is of vital importance to detect the anomalies and processed accordingly in real time. In previous work, some methods, which analyze the collected industrial sensor data on cloud computing center to detect anomalies, casually increase both the transmission pressure of bandwidth and the computing pressure on cloud center. By contrast, some other methods based on edge computing detect anomalies on edge nodes, but they only take the anomalies of sensor data from single-source time series into account and ignore the correlation anomalies between the data from multi-source time series. In this paper, we first present an anomaly detection model in distributed edge computing. Then, the Edge Computing based Anomaly Detection Algorithm (ECADA), which can detect the anomalies from both single-source time series or multi-source time series is proposed. Finally, we conduct a series comparison experiments in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in the paper. And the experimental results demonstrate that both the anomalies from single-source time series and the anomalies from multi-source time series can be accurately detected by the proposed algorithm. Specifically, it performs more efficient and effective when there exist the anomalies of new type.}

Benchmarking and monitoring of urban design and transport features is crucial to achieving local and international health and sustainability goals. However, most urban indicator frameworks use coarse spatial scales that either only allow between-city comparisons, or require expensive, technical, local spatial analyses for within-city comparisons. This study developed a reusable, open-source urban indicator computational framework using open data to enable consistent local and global comparative analyses. We show this framework by calculating spatial indicators—for 25 diverse cities in 19 countries—of urban design and transport features that support health and sustainability. We link these indicators to cities’ policy contexts, and identify populations living above and below critical thresholds for physical activity through walking. Efforts to broaden participation in crowdsourcing data and to calculate globally consistent indicators are essential for planning evidence-informed urban interventions, monitoring policy effects, and learning lessons from peer cities to achieve health, equity, and sustainability goals.}

Many past research works suggest low duty cycle networking for energy-efficient wireless sensor network; however, research problem still persist as these proposals have some practical deployment bottlenecks like sleep-latency and may trade-off with data-fidelity and Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters. The research objective of this work is to propose a novel design for wireless sensor–actuator mote system to minimize energy consumption and compensate with harvesting to achieve energy neutral operation in multi-hop Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN); A network scenario that is much needed for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications in future ready Next-gen Cyber Physical System (NG-CPS).

In addition to energy conservation, we have also proposed a hybrid harvesting to compensate energy to achieve energy neutral self-sustainable NG-CPS. The proposed novel LDCS-TR-SPTF has been implemented on multiple custom-made sensor–actuator motes equipped with ARM-based System-on-Chip (SoC) and IEEE 802.11 network interface. These motes are working both as end-nodes and relay nodes in a multi-hop WSAN testbed scenario for testing and validation of our proposed scheme. The results are promising with an overall energy conservation of 49.1% using our novel LDCS-TR-SPTF in comparison to stock IEEE 802.11. We have implemented solar energy harvester on wireless sensor–actuator motes to compensate the reduced energy consumption and achieved complete energy-neutrality.

abstract = {Multi-access edge computing (MEC) provides cloud-like services at the edge of the radio access network close to mobile devices (MDs). This infrastructure can provide low-latency services to MDs and significantly reduce the pressure on the backbone network. However, the computing resources configured on an edge server (ES) are limited compared to a cloud data center (DC). It is difficult for ESs to satisfy the demands of MDs anytime and anywhere. Thus, a new paradigm that combines DC with ESs has been proposed to provide better capability and flexibility, namely, cloud-assisted MEC (CA-MEC). In CA-MEC, MDs can offload tasks to ESs and the DC, which means more elasticity and more complicated offloading decisions. This paper studies MDs’ energy-efficient computation offloading strategy in CA-MEC, which considers two different priority tasks. First, we establish mathematical models to characterize the CA-MEC environment. Second, we mathematically analyze the MD’s average task response time and average power consumption. Third, we propose efficient numerical algorithms to obtain a computation offloading strategy to optimize the energy efficiency of the target MD. Finally, we demonstrate several numerical examples and construct a comparative experiment to show the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization poses great challenges to China's urban land use sustainability (ULUS). Land is the essential space to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, so SDGs provide a new guide to evaluate land use sustainability. However, there is still a lack of SDGs-oriented assessment of urban land use at national level. Moreover, there is still a need to address the problems about the randomness and fuzziness within evaluation, which tends to cause more uncertainties. Here we developed a SDGs-oriented evaluation framework based on the cloud model and derived the spatial and temporal patterns of urban land use sustainability for China at the prefecture-level from 2004 to 2019. Then, we used the McKinsey matrix to classify the types of urban land use sustainability, and examined their main drivers using the Geodetector method. The results showed that the development level of ULUS in China was high in the east and low in the west. High-value hotspots were mainly distributed in primary and secondary urban agglomerations in China. From 2004 to 2019, the development level of ULUS in China gradually increased, but the growth rate slowed down. In 2009 the value of central China exceeded that of the northeast. In contrast, the coordination level of ULUS had declined in more than 50% of Chinese cities during the study period. The high values were in southern China, northeast China, and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, while the low values were in central and southern Liaoning and the urban agglomeration in the Central Plains. The development level was mainly controlled by anthropogenic activities and urban development, while natural conditions constrained the improvement of the coordination level. Combining the development and coordination, we found that cities with higher development level often had a wide range of coordination level, and suggestions were put forward for different regions to achieve sustainable land use. Our research provides scientific guidance for China's territory planning and sustainable urban development.}

In this study, an energy-aware virtual machine scheduling model is proposed which is based on the multi-unit nondiscriminatory combinatorial auction. The model includes a powerful bidding language that allows users to declare their complicated virtual machine requests using logical AND and OR relations along with the time constraints. The study also presents the formal definition of the model and the associated optimization problem for determining the optimum schedule and energy-efficient placement of VMs on physical servers. The optimization problem is formulated using integer linear programming and several heuristic solution methods including the Genetic Algorithm are proposed for this problem. The performances of the model and the proposed heuristics are assessed on a comprehensive test suite. The proposed model is estimated to provide approximately a 37% improvement in revenues, and the solution methods are estimated to provide high-quality solutions within only 5% of the optimum which enable the model to be deployed in large-scale clouds.}

This paper defined energy sustainability from the four dimensions of security, efficiency, cleanness and low carbon emissions, established an index system and evaluated the energy sustainability levels of 30 provinces in China by the Improved Entropy Weight-Cloud Model (IEW-CM). The results show that: (1) General energy sustainability in Chinese provinces is deficient, and energy cleanness and efficiency perform better than security and low carbon emissions. (2) Chinese energy sustainability has obvious spatial heterogeneity and within the same province, the level is unbalanced in four dimensions. The characteristics of energy sustainability exhibit significant differences in different regions. (3) Energy security and low carbon emissions play a crucial role in achieving energy sustainability. Natural gas deliverability, energy consumption elasticity coefficient, CO2 emission per unit of energy and share of fossil energy consumption are the primary factors affecting energy sustainability differences among provinces.}

This paper presents energy-efficient data migration approach using hybrid optimized deep learning in a heterogeneous cloud. Simulation of the cloud is carried out with Physical Machines (PM), container, and Virtual Machines (VM) in the cloud. Migration application is done with proposed Taylor Lion-based Poor and Rich Optimization (Taylor Lion-based PRO), wherein load is found by Actor Critic Neural Network (ACNN). Moreover, objective functions utilized are agility, migration time, predicted load, demand, transmission cost, resource capacity, energy consumption, as well as reputation. Here, Taylor Lion-based PRO is formed by hybridization of the Taylor series along Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA), and Poor and Rich Optimization (PRO). Furthermore, the performance of data migration concerning interoperability is carried out with three performance metrics, like load, resource capacity, and energy consumption of 0.006, 0.364, and 0.281.}

The accuracy and time it takes for different search engines to retrieve information from a cloud computing repository around the world, varies. However, it has been discovered in the literature that webpage ranking reduces the amount of time a user spends surfing, which saves a significant amount of energy during computation and transmission across the network. The hyperlink structure of the web graph is used in most of the earlier solutions documented in the literature, which consumes a lot of energy during calculation. It may exacerbate the link leakage problem by increasing the frequency of spam pages. In light of the energy consumption of various smart gadgets, hyperlink structure alone is no longer sufficient for predicting webpage relevance. Its true importance is revealed by user surfing activity. To improve search engine accuracy and speed, it is critical to demote spam pages, lowering energy consumption. Among all the existing ranking algorithms in the literature, one of the important components is the PageRank algorithm used by Google’s ranking module. Keeping focus on these points, in this paper, various page ranking algorithms based upon supervised learning are surveyed and summarized with respect to different selected parameters and experiments performed. Using this information, a detailed taxonomy of search engine results is presented in the text. Moreover, PageRank algorithms are explored by using different supervised learning techniques applied in the existing proposals for getting and processing the results. In the nutshell, the PageRank methodology is surveyed with respect to web spam detection which is the demand of cognitive systems in smart cities.}

The deployment of renewable energy generators such as PhotoVoltaic (PV) and wind farms is an attractive candidate to reduce the carbon footprint and, achieve the sustainable cloud datacenters. However, current studies have focused on geographical load balancing of Virtual Machine (VM) requests to reduce the cost of brown energy usage, while most of them have ignored the heterogeneity of power consumption of each cloud datacenter and the incurred performance degradation by VM co-location. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Energy Efficient Virtual Machine Allocation (EEE-VMA), a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based metaheuristic which supports a power heterogeneity aware VM request allocation of multiple sustainable cloud datacenters. This approach provides a novel metric called powerMark which diagnoses the power efficiency of each cloud datacenter in order to reduce the energy consumption of cloud datacenters more efficiently. Furthermore, performance degradation caused by VM co-location and bandwidth cost between cloud service users and cloud datacenters are considered to avoid the deterioration of Quality-of-Service (QoS) required by cloud service users by using our proposed cost model. Extensive experiments including real-world traces based simulation and the implementation of cloud testbed with a power measuring device are conducted to demonstrate the energy efficiency and performance assurance of the proposed EEE-VMA approach compared to the existing VM request allocation strategies.}

Conventional load frequency control has difficulty overcoming the above problems due to its lack of adaptive control ability and robustness. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a sea computing-based grid-area coordinated load frequency control (SCGAC-LFC) method, which equates each grid unit and area unit in each area as independent agents. Instead of different units relying on different strategies, all units collectively obtain the LFC policy that suits the market requirements. In its online application, no communication is needed since each unit can arrive at its own decision. In addition, this paper proposes a curriculum multiagent deep meta-actor-critic (CMA-DMAC) algorithm, which introduces meta-reinforcement learning and curriculum learning to guide the agent training to improve the robustness and quality of the obtained SCGAC-LFC strategies. Using a simulation of the four-area LFC model for the China Southern Grid (CSG), our proposed method carries significantly lower frequency error and regulation mileage payment.}

It has transformed resources into scalable services on demand and provides the only solution to the high resource requirements. All cloud service providers usually offer all types of services in the cloud computing environment, even though they also handle security-related challenges like reliability, availability, and throughput. One of the most decisive challenges in the cloud is handling faults. High fault tolerance in the cloud is a must to attain high performance, and the defects must be investigated and examined for future guidance. The principal target of this paper is to gain insight into the fault tolerance techniques that are available to us and the challenges that are required to be overcome. We concluded that there is always a relation between faults and energy consumption during our survey. If there is a high potential to tolerate a fault, there will be a need for more infrastructure and devices to fix those faults, which further leads to more power consumption. In this paper, 129 Research papers published through February 2022 were considered and further classified. This paper critically reviews techniques to toleratefaultsin cloud computing systems and discusses the taxonomy of errors, faults, and failures. Furthermore, this paper aims to investigate several critical research topics and advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, the Internet of Things, and machine learning, that may be employed as an intelligent fault tolerance strategy in the cloud environment.}

abstract = {Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of service providers offering Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). The main goal of service providers is to offer guaranteed service (GB/month) for all contents by meeting sustainability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): cost-efficiency and security. To minimize the risk of physical deployment and handle partial recovery, network slicing between service providers is considered by using the same FWA as a service by joint consideration of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). This can only be handled by Software-Defined Network (SDN) controlled OpenFlow-based FWA. However, current OpenFlow switches in the market are used only as IaaS which does not meet cost-efficiency requirement alone. The software-defined OpenFlow tables can be increased by network administrator, which is not recommended because of having no authorization limitation and poses configuration risks on the device. Here, the research question is how can the service providers keep their own network sustainable by using infrastructure in a secure, cost-efficient, and conforming to the standard in a fair way? Therefore, Sustainable Fixed Wireless Access (SFWA) is newly proposed by OpenFlow-based blockchain in this paper. To handle low computational work and fair scheduling, Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and Weighted Fair Content Scheduling algorithms are proposed for the validation process of the blocks that stores dynamic configuration details of service providers. At the end of the whole procedure, the valid blockchain is stored in the Secure Policy Database in OpenFlow-based FWA switches. According to performance evaluation, eMBB and URLLC contents can be served by 40% and 53% discount on cost per user with guaranteed service in FWA. The service provider offers a more sustainable network by blockchain-based secured SFWA than the conventional centralized authority-based FWA.}

According to the above mentioned, we integrate HEH technology into MEC to solve the limited energy problem of MD in this paper. Besides, to maximize the system utility (SU), a SU model with three measurable indicators of the latency, remaining energy and task success rate is proposed. Then, we improve the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) algorithm and propose twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TDDDPG) algorithm to obtain the suboptimal solution of proposed model.

The test microgrid comprises of two PV units and one wind generator synchronized via Voltage Source Converters (VSC) in the ac side. Each VSC is regulated based on power generation in individual micro sources. The operation of VSC is the key factor maintaining the stability of the micro grid. Each VSC is controlled by outer power loop and inner current regulation loop employing PI controllers. The performance of the VSC is enhanced using the proposed hybrid GRFO – iForest algorithm for tuning the PI controller gains. The performance of the proposed approach is then compared with conventional tuning PI controller and optimization techniques like Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) and Modified Ant Lion optimization based Artificial Neural Network (MALANN). The gain parameter of the proposed controller is optimally tuned and the controller provides reliable sustainable microgrid system operation. The proposed approach is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and validated using OP-4500 Real Time Simulator environment. Based on the results, the performance of the GRFO-iForest approach is superior during steady-state and transient operation. It enhances the sustainability of the microgrid by restoring normal operating conditions after a small physical disturbance and the microgrid remains stable with the optimized regulator. The stability of the overall system is proved with the mathematical model.}

Through an analysis of responses to the first inquiry questions, we were able to address the residing interoperability between AI models, distributed BD frameworks, and cloud-fog systems. Unfortunately, only 10% of respondents were adopting energy metrics when evaluating their implementations. Even worse, multi-level energy consumption measurement techniques were not evident to most respondents. Accordingly, we provided a useful guideline of various multi-level energy and power estimation approaches.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess actual evapotranspiration – ETa derived from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land – SEBAL model with and without satellite image fusion as input of a soil water balance in a pilot area of sugarcane in the semiarid region of Brazil. A fusion of Landsat sensors’ and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer – MODIS’ images was completed through a Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model – STARFM script developed using cloud computing, and its performance in estimating key variables for the radiation balance was evaluated. ETa and irrigation were daily estimated between June, 2015 and May, 2016 by combining STARFM with SEBAL and evaluated according to the Bowen ratio technique and irrigation data. In addition, one-minute surface meteorological elements at the satellite overpass times were used. STARFM performed well with RMSE of 17.00 W m−2, 2.28 K, 0.07, and 0.01 for Rn, Ts, NDVI, and albedo, respectively. The metrics employed to evaluate ETa estimates indicated that the SEBAL+STARFM has low mean errors (PBIAS = −2.75% and RMSE = 0.97 mm d−1 and 16.66 mm month−1) and high coefficient of determination (0.87 for daily ETa–ET24, and 0.91 for monthly ETa), in comparison with SEBAL using Landsat-only images (PBIAS = −5.25%, RMSE = 0.97 mm d−1 and 17.66 mm month−1, r² = 0.92). Adding fused images resulted in a better fit of the estimated cumulative ET24 curve to the measured ET24. The water balance indicated that the cultivated cane suffered water stress, which was better represented by estimates using the ET24 curve with the addition of fused images than Landsat images alone. Although this increase in temporal resolution of the estimated ET24 data indicated a greater water consumption, it informs a quantity that would be sufficient to meet the water demand of the crops.}

abstract = {Virtualization technology provides a new way to improve resource utilization and cloud service throughput. However, the randomness of task arrival, tight coupling between resource load imbalance and node heterogeneity, high computing power, and other factors have hindered the energy consumption optimization and cost reduction objectives of the existing technology. Consequently, task scheduling failure cannot be easily eliminated, and cloud computing performance is decreased dramatically. In this study, a strong agile response task scheduling optimization algorithm is proposed on the basis of the peak energy consumption of data centers and the time span of task scheduling. Agile response optimization techniques are also adopted. From the perspective of task failure rate, the proposed algorithm can be used to investigate the strong agile response optimization model, explore the probability density function of the task request queue overflow, and request a timeout to avoid network congestion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the stability and efficiency of task scheduling and effectively improve the throughput of the cloud computing system.}

abstract = {The hybrid renewable energy distributed energy system (DES) has great application potential due to its cleanliness and high energy efficiency. In existing DES studies, complex energy storage systems are invested in addressing the mismatch between energy supply and demand. However, this investment mode would result in large investments and low device utilization rates. This work connects DES to cloud energy storage (CES, a shared energy storage provider) to build the DES storage system in a subscription mode. The subscription mode enables the proposed DES-CES to dynamically adjust its storage capacity and power by changing storage service contracts. Then, an active energy reserve-based multi-stage dual-scenario collaborative management strategy is designed to dispatch DES-CES. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to optimize the design and operation of DES-CES, considering economic, environmental, and flexibility performances. Simulation results show that the formulated three performances form a sustainability frontier for DES-CES. This frontier has suitable renewable energy integration levels that consider system consumption ability. Compared to the investment mode, the annual equivalent storage capacity and power under the proposed subscription mode are less, reducing storage costs by 13%–53% (depending on given performances). This work provides references and methodology for DES to join CES.}

In this dynamic environment, cloud resources are inherently multidimensional, encompassing computing machines and communication connections susceptible to failures and energy-related considerations. However, given two-objective energy and reliability optimization, existing time allocation policies focus primarily on optimizing a single intent, which leads to system degradation in environments that generate problematic constraints from executable processing units. To handle the shortcomings of the application placement policies, we suggest a solution in the form of a three-phase bi-objective workflow scheduling issue called (Bi-OWSP). This three-phase approach aims to optimize workflow scheduling by simultaneously considering energy and reliability as two vital objectives. To achieve this, we employ two distinct algorithms. First is the stepwise dynamic voltage and frequency scale algorithm ensures energy efficiency by calculating optimal frequencies, reducing energy usage, and minimizing task mapping time. The second algorithm is the reliability-conscious heterogeneous fault tolerance approach, which emphasizes avoiding high-deficit servers and communication links to enhance system reliability. Furthermore, we introduce an energy-aware stepwise reliability maximization algorithm, which intelligently selects the best combination of task-server pairs to achieve energy minimization and reliability maximization. Through extensive simulation experiments on artificial and real-world workflow applications, we demonstrate the significance of Bi-OWSP in providing superior energy-reliability compensation solutions compared to competing algorithms.}

It has its own application domain to upload the clinical data of the patients and treatment procedures to the cloud server. Moreover, the data user may process the queries with suitable sensing parameters to obtain an appropriate medical record. As a result, the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) demands practical insights, trustworthiness, and reliability of intelligent automation to prevent the occurrence of potential risks in the process of production. In the past, multi-keyword searching (MKS) over encrypted cloud data has attracted researchers' attention. As cloud computing is highly practicing, data owners may easily outsource any kind of system data to commercial sites using the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT). However, data privacy and protection should be ensured using encryption techniques before any sensitive data is outsourced over insecure public networks. Providing cloud data encryption and secure keyword searching still exist as challenging issues. In I-IoT, cloud computing deals with a large amount of data users and documents, thus a technique like MKS is highly necessitated to process the search request and secure query processing. Thus, this paper presents a privacy-preservation phrase with multi-keyword ranked searching (PPP-MKRS) that introduces optimized filtering, binary tree index structure, and conjunctive keyword search to achieve secure searching efficiency. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed PPP-MKRS scheme consumes less computation, storage, and verification time in comparison with other searching encryption techniques.}

Fortunately, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) can promote energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises to achieve smart and sustainable production. In Industry 4.0, various advanced technologies are used to achieve smart manufacturing, but the sustainability of production is often ignored without considering ESG performance. This study proposes a strategy of edge-cloud cooperation-driven smart and sustainable production to realise data collection, preprocessing, storage and analysis. In detail, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is used to decrease the interference of abnormal data in the evaluation results. Subsequently, an improved technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) based on the adversarial interpretative structural model (AISM) is proposed to evaluate the production efficiency of the manufacturing workshop and make the analysis results more intuitive. Then, the architecture and models are verified using real production data from a partner company. Finally, sustainable analysis is discussed from the perspective of energy consumption, economic impact, greenhouse gas emissions and pollution prevention.}

As a result, an SG needs connectivity, automation and device tracking. The Internet of Things is used to do this (IoT). This study presents an IoT-enabled smart grid monitoring and control system in a computer network. Here the IoT module has been used in monitoring the network which is integrated with (MLDRNN). Renewable (DER) should be combined in grids to make electricity supply more reliable and reduce transmission losses. The control system of smart grid has been enhanced using (CPCS). The suggested system is scalable, modular, and allows for the interoperability of various types of inverters, as well as data transmission over a secure communication channel. All of these characteristics, combined with its low cost, make the created control system and monitoring platform ideal for monitoring smart microgrids online.

Efficient energy consumption in Smart Cities has a massive impact on the environment. But, computational power is increasing rapidly in the cloud computing environment. Enormous energy consumption (EC) and Service Level Agreement violation (SLAV) becomes a key concern. The Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation approach can significantly reduce EC, SLA violation (SLAV), and increase resource utilization. However, dynamic VM consolidation may produce performance degradation of Physical Machines (PMs) and SLAV. Therefore, it becomes essential to find a trade-off between EC and SLAV. Herein, a novel New Linear Regression(NLR) prediction model, host overload/underload, and VM placement policy have been proposed to reduce EC and SLAV. The NLR model’s primary intention is to take that the model goes through a straight line and a mean point. Future CPU utilization is predicted based on the proposed NLR model. Evaluation of proposed algorithms has been accomplished by extending CloudSim Simulator. The experiment shows that proposed algorithms reduced EC and SLAV in cloud data centers and can be used to construct a smart and sustainable environment for Smart Cities.}

Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated method for intelligent green scheduling of the sustainable flexible workshop with edge computing considering uncertain machine state. Firstly, a multi-objective model for green scheduling is built and solved with the makespan, processing cost, processing quality and energy consumption as its optimisation objectives. Then, a hardware system for intelligent monitoring and diagnosis of machine state is established based on wireless sensor network (WSN), edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the diagnosis results of machine state provide feedback to the original green scheduling scheme and the corresponding real-time adjustment called green rescheduling is conducted to response to uncertain dynamic machine state. A case study of intelligent green scheduling where several machines fall into fault operation suddenly is employed to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method, and it is compared with other multi-objective optimisation algorithms for green scheduling. The results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the rivals on this issue.}

However, the notion of energy harvesting management for sustainable urban computing is still growing exponentially, and it should be attended to due to economic factors and governmental obstacles. This paper reviews different existing green energy harvesting strategies on the smart applications of sustainable and smart cities in edge-based intelligent urban computing.

This review aims to classify technical aspects of energy harvesting management methods in sustainable urban computing concerning applied algorithms, evaluation factors, and evaluation environments.

Although metaheuristics are very attractive to solve this problem, most of the existing work regards the problem as a black-box and ignores the use of domain knowledge. To make up for their shortcomings, this paper tailors an energy-aware intelligent scheduling algorithm (EIS) with three new mechanisms. First, we derive the optimal execution time that minimizes energy consumption for each task on a given resource. Second, based on the optimal execution time of each workflow task, the EIS distributes the workflow slack time (difference between its completion time and deadline) to reduce the voltages and frequencies of task executions for energy saving. Third, the EIS mines the idle time gaps caused by task precedence constraints to further reduce dynamic energy consumption whilst satisfying workflows’ deadline constraints. To measure the performance of the EIS, we conduct extensive comparison experiments based on actual workflow applications. The results demonstrate that the energy consumption of the EIS is much lower than that of the competitors under different deadlines, and has a faster descend rate with the evolution process.}

abstract = {Android-based smart devices cater to services in almost every aspect of our lives like personal, professional, social, banking, business, etc. However, people with increasingly dependent on the smartphone, malicious attacks against these gadgets have increased exponentially. To achieve a secured smart environment for future sustainable computing, android-based smart devices must provide more resilient and attack-resistant commitments, so that the android malware detector, once trained on a dataset, can continue to identify new malware without retraining. However, most of the existing malware detection approach suffers from a high false-positive rate and low detection rate of new malware variants. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, an Optimized and efficient Ensemble Learning-based Android Malware Detection framework, called “OEL-AMD” is proposed. This framework employs statistical feature engineering to eliminate non-informative features as well as encode statistical characteristics, and Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (BGWO)-based meta-heuristic feature selection is used to prepare optimal feature sets for static and dynamic layers. Subsequently, different base learners are trained using hyper-parameters tuning to boost the inductive reasoning capability of the ensemble model for classification, and an aggregated performance is computed. The obtained highest classification accuracy is 96.95% for binary and 83.49% for the category classification using static and dynamic layer features, respectively reveals the promising performance. Further, the obtained results are compared with the existing methods, and statistical significance is evaluated. The statistical test verified the significance of the obtained results.}

abstract = {High availability in network services is a crucial requirement for quality of experience. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distribute Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are under contemplation by many researchers across the globe because these attacks directly target services availability. For this reason, cloud providers use the auto-scaling feature in Cloud Computing Environments (CCE), in which cloud resources scale dynamically on demand. DoS/DDoS attacks on CCE, using auto-scaling, do not deny services but cause high resource usage and substantial financial damages that become an Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDOS) attack. One of the DoS/DDoS attacks, resulting EDOS attack is the Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) flooding attack. In this paper, a novel technique, ICMP detection and mitigation model (EDOS-IDM) is proposed that can detect and mitigate Volumetric and Normal Behavioral ICMP traffic attacks. The results from the proposed technique are compared with the Normal Behavioral ICMP traffic attack because it causes least resource usage among all the mitigation techniques. According to our study, there is no such technique that can handle normal behavioral ICMP traffic attack. The technique is practically tested and evaluated on OpenStack production Cloud Environment test bed. According to the results, the technique is proved to save extra resource consumption and customer's bills in a cloud computing environment.}

abstract = {Minimizing the energy consumption of servers within cloud computing systems is of upmost importance to cloud providers toward reducing operational costs and enhancing service sustainability by consolidating services onto fewer active servers. Moreover, providers must also provision high levels of availability and reliability, hence cloud services are frequently replicated across servers that subsequently increases server energy consumption and resource overhead. These two objectives can present a potential conflict within cloud resource management decision making that must balance between service consolidation and replication to minimize energy consumption whilst maximizing server availability and reliability, respectively. In this paper, we propose a cuckoo optimization-based energy-reliability aware resource scheduling technique (CRUZE) for holistic management of cloud computing resources including servers, networks, storage, and cooling systems. CRUZE clusters and executes heterogeneous workloads on provisioned cloud resources and enhances the energy-efficiency and reduces the carbon footprint in datacenters without adversely affecting cloud service reliability. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRUZE against existing state-of-the-art solutions using the CloudSim toolkit. Results indicate that our proposed technique is capable of reducing energy consumption by 20.1% whilst improving reliability and CPU utilization by 17.1% and 15.7% respectively without affecting other Quality of Service parameters.}

However, the full commitment to Cloud Computing necessary to gain the full benefit is a major project for any organisation, since it necessitates adoption of new business processes and attitudes to computing services in addition to the immediately obvious systems changes. Hence the evaluation of a Cloud Computing project needs to consider the balance of benefits and risks to the organisation in the full context of the environment in which it operates; it is not sufficient or appropriate to examine technical considerations alone. In this paper, we consider the application of CAPM, a well established approach used for the analysis of risks and benefits of commercial projects to Cloud adoption projects and propose a revised and improved technique, OSM. To support the validity of OSM, two full case studies are presented. In the first, we describe an application of the approach to the iSolutions Group at University of Southampton, which focuses on evaluations of Cloud Computing service improvement. We then illustrate the use of OSM for measuring learning satisfaction of two cohort groups at the University of Greenwich. The results confirm the advantages of using OSM. We conclude that OSM can analyse the risk and return status of Cloud Computing services and help organisations that adopt Cloud Computing to evaluate and review their Cloud Computing projects and services. OSM is an emerging service and analytics model supported by several case studies.}

Due to its structural qualities, which include low thickness and compact 2D dimensions, it has also been recognized as a promising nanomaterial for water-barrier applications. For barrier polymer applications, it is usually applied using two main strategies. The first is the application of graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to polymeric substrates through transfer or coating. In the second method, fully exfoliated GO or rGO is integrated into the material.

abstract = {Cloud computing is a mainstay of modern technology, offering cost-effective and scalable solutions to a variety of different problems. The massive shift of organization resource needs from local systems to cloud-based systems has greatly increased the costs incurred by cloud providers in expanding, maintaining, and supplying server, storage, network, and processing hardware. Due to the large scale at which cloud providers operate, even small performance degradation issues can cause energy or resource usage costs to rise dramatically. One way in which cloud providers may improve cost reduction is by reducing energy consumption. The use of intelligent task-scheduling algorithms to allocate user-deployed jobs to servers can reduce the amount of energy consumed. Conventional task scheduling algorithms involve both heuristic and metaheuristic methods. Recently, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize task scheduling has seen significant progress, including the Gated Graph Convolution Network (GGCN). This paper proposes a new approach called HunterPlus which examine the effect of extending the GGCN’s Gated Recurrent Unit to a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit. The paper also studies the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in optimizing cloud–fog task scheduling. Experimental results show that the CNN scheduler outperforms the GGCN-based models in both energy consumption per task and job completion rate metrics by at least 17 and 10.4 percent, respectively.}

VM technology has quickly become a pillar of data centers and cluster systems because to its utility in partitioning, consolidating, and moving workloads. VM placement is another thing that affects the quality of consolidation. It is important to design a system that improves energy efficiency by allocating resources to applications in a smart way while still meeting QoS requirements for applications. Moreover, the security of information that is being processed during the migration process is also one of the important tasks.

abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness.}

The main objective of this analysis isto explore various kinds of attacks and its solution model of the cloud. Side channel attacks are detected by using various techniques such as RSA and AES. Infrastructure level attacks are analyzed with various attack levels and rates. Hypervisor level protection is assessed by using the different classes with accurate parameters. The overall analysis provides the complete information about cloud resource level security and its solution.}

abstract = {Nowadays, quantum computing plays a significant role in reducing the execution time in complicated computations. There are different reversible algorithms for quantum computation and many quantum circuits theoretically designed until now. These designs are only built from reversible gates because reversibility is a necessary logic in quantum circuits. Additionally, ternary representation can allow designing a circuit with fewer inputs and outputs, leading to a considerable decline in size or number of qutrits. Although other papers in quantum ternary reversible logic are in unbalanced representation, this paper, for the first time, considers balanced ternary advantages to achieve a more efficient design for quantum multipliers as the main component in arithmetic blocks. Six criteria are introduced to show how balanced representation increases the overall performance. In this work, two general balanced ternary adder blocks (full-adder and half-adder) and two balanced ternary partial product generators (BTPPGs) are proposed, and also a 2 × 2 and a 3 × 3 balanced ternary multipliers built from these components. The quantum costs of proposed balanced ternary multipliers enhanced 17% for a 2 × 2 multiplier and 34% for a 3 × 3 multiplier.}

abstract = {Network-accessible task offloading is for low latency; offline task offloading is for low cost. Offline devices cannot directly access service nodes due to lack of resources. Accordingly, the latter involves more steps and optimization variables such as: where to offload tasks, how to allocate computation resources, how to adjust offloading ratio and transmit power, and such optimization variables and hybrid combination features are highly coupled with each other. In this paper, we first formulate a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming Problem (MINLP) for such task offloading under energy and delay constraints. Furthermore, we decompose it into two subproblems so as to efficiently solve the formulated MINLP, and design a low-cost and low-complexity Joint Optimization for Energy Consumption and Task Processing Delay (JOET) algorithm to optimize selection decisions, resource allocation, offloading ratio and transmit power adjustment. We carry out extensive simulation experiments to validate JOET. Simulation results demonstrate that JOET outperforms many representative existing schemes in quickly converge and effective reduction of energy consumption and delay. Specifically, the average energy consumption and the average delay have been reduced by 15.93% and 13.70%, respectively, and the load balancing efficiency has increased by 10.20%.}
