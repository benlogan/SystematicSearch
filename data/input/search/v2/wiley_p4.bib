abstract = {Summary In recent years, applying Internet of Things (IoT) applications has significantly increased to facilitate and improve quality of human life activities in various fields such as healthcare, education, industry, economics, etc. The energy aware cloud-edge computing paradigm has developed as a hybrid computing solution to provide IoT applications using available cloud service providers and fog nodes for the smart devices and mobile applications. Since the IoT applications are developed in the form of several IoT services with various quality of service (QoS) metrics which can deploy on the cloud-edge providers with different resource capabilities, finding an efficient placement solution as one of challenging topics to be measured for IoT applications. The service placement issue arranges IoT applications on the cloud-edge providers with various capabilities of atomic services though sufficient different QoS factors to support service level agreement (SLA) contracts. This paper presents a technical analysis on the cloud-edge service placement approaches in IoT systems. The key point of this technical analysis is to identify substantial studies in the service placement approaches which need additional consideration to progress more efficient and effective placement strategies in IoT environments. In addition, a side-by-side taxonomy is proposed to categorize the relevant studies on cloud-edge service placement approaches and algorithms. A statistical and technical analysis of reviewed existing approaches is provided, and evaluation factors and attributes are discussed. Finally, open issues and forthcoming challenges of service placement approaches are presented.},

abstract = {Abstract Over the last decade, the use of agile methods has grown dramatically for software development. Agile methods guarantee to accelerate the delivery of remarkable software with increased user satisfaction and reduced cost. However, in recent years, due to emergence of green software engineering, software developers are compelled to focus more on green and sustainable aspects of software. Global software engineering aims to design, develop, and use a software with limited energy and computing resources. Recently, software engineers in global software development (GSD) have adapted agile methods for quick, interactive, and environment-friendly software development. However, there is a lack of specific practices to be followed by GSD vendors in the development of green and sustainable software. In this study, we have identified 36 agile practices through systematic literature review and applied contrived search criteria derived from the research questions; 53 relevant papers were identified and reviewed. Findings of the systematic literature review were then empirically validated through questionnaire survey in GSD industry, in which 106 relevant experts from 25 different countries participated. The identified agile practices are intended to assist GSD vendors in strengthening their agile maturity towards green and sustainable software development.},

abstract = {Abstract Cloud computing has recently attracted both academics and industrialists in the field of research. Virtualization allows cloud service providers (CSPs) with their own data centers to supply infrastructures, resources, and services to users by converting real servers into virtual machines (VMs). Profit-driven CSPs charge users for VM leasing and service access while reducing energy consumption to increase profits. But CSPs even face challenges like minimizing the energy cost for the data center. Several different algorithms were introduced for minimizing the energy cost by using task scheduling (TS) and/or resource provisioning. However, scalability issues were encountered, or TS with task dependencies were not considered, which is a critical factor in assuring exact parallel execution of tasks in parallel. This article introduces a novel artificial algorithm, called deep reinforcement Q-learning for resource scheduling which integrates the features of the Q-learning and reinforcement learning approaches. The objective of this new approach is to provide a solution to the problem of handling energy consumption in a cloud computing environment. Based on advancements in WorkflowSim, experiments are carried out comparatively by considering the variance of make-span, time, cost analysis, deadline overflow, and load balance in resource scheduling. The proposed method tends to be effective in terms of cost, energy consumption, resource utilization, and response time. The resource reuse capability of the proposed methodology is 63\% higher when compared to the modified particle swarm optimization and modified cat swarm optimization technique. The task approval rate of the proposed methodology is 54\% higher than the crow search-based load balancing algorithm and 50\% higher than the task duplication-based scheduling algorithm.},

The design case value was compared with the actual value and the simulation accuracy was assessed in terms of mean base error and cumulative root mean square error. A comparison was done for two conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems with evaporative cooling pad system, which was found to be both energy- and cost-efficient.

This article describes the design and implementation of ERmod, and illustrates its performance in solvent water for two organic solutes and two protein solutes. Actually, the free-energy computation with ERmod is not restricted to the solvation in homogeneous medium such as fluid and polymer and can treat the binding into weakly ordered system with nano-inhomogeneity such as micelle and lipid membrane.

abstract = {Abstract With the resource-constrained nature of mobile devices and the resource-abundant offerings of the cloud, several promising optimisation techniques have been proposed by the green computing research community. Prominent techniques and unique methods have been developed to offload resource intensive tasks from mobile devices to the cloud. Although these schemes address similar questions within the same domain of mobile cloud application (MCA) optimisation, evaluation is tailored to the scheme and also solely mobile focused, thus making it difficult to clearly compare with other existing counterparts. In this work, we first analyse the existing/commonly adopted evaluation technique, then with the aim to fill the above gap, we propose the behaviour-driven full-tier green evaluation approach, which adopts the behaviour-driven concept for evaluating MCA performance and energy usage—ie, green metrics. To automate the evaluation process, we also present and evaluate the effectiveness of a resultant application program interface and tool driven by the behaviour-driven full-tier green evaluation approach. The application program interface is based on Android and has been validated with Elastic Compute Cloud instance. Experiments show that Beftigre is capable of providing a more distinctive, comparable, and reliable green test results for MCAs.},

Each framework has significant impact on robustness, scalability, fault-tolerance, energy efficiency, and so on of the cloud. To bring good characteristics of open source clouds and commercial clouds under a roof, a six layered green cloud framework namely SERVmegh is proposed. Resource management, green power management, workload analyzer and manager, and on/off control components of SERVmegh framework are designed and developed. Energy-efficient resource wastage reduction methodology for resource management is proposed. Algorithms for resource management, virtual machine placement, and minimization of virtual machine migrations using resource wastage reduction methodology are implemented.

It addresses issues related to scheduling, load balancing, data replication, virtual machine placement, and networking that can be capitalized on to reduce the energy consumption in data centers. Enabling the sleep mode in idle computing servers and network hardware is the most efficient method of avoiding unnecessary power consumption. Consequently, load balancing becomes the key enabler for saving energy. Energy consumption virtualized data centers can be reduced by an appropriate decision on which physical server a virtual machine should be placed. Costs and operating expenses have become a growing concern in the cloud computing industry, with energy consumption accounting for a large percentage of the operational expenses in the data centers used as backend computing infrastructure.}

abstract = {Summary Based on a pay-as-you-go model, cloud computing provides the possibility of hosting pervasive applications from both academic and business domains. However, data centers hosting cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and large carbon footprints to the environment. Energy-aware resource provisioning is an effective solution to diminish the energy consumption of cloud data centers. Recently, a growing trend has emerged, where cloud technology is used to run periodic real-time applications such as multimedia, telecommunication, video gaming, and industrial applications. In order for a real-time application to be able to use cloud services, cloud providers have to be able to provide timing guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an energy-aware resource provisioning mechanism for cloud data centers, which are capable of serving real-time periodic tasks following the Software as a Service model. The proposed method is compared against an energy-aware version of the RT-OpenStack. RT-OpenStack is a recently proposed approach to provide a time-predictable version of OpenStack. The experimental results manifest that our proposed resource provisioning method outperforms energy-aware version of the RT-OpenStack by 16.01\%, 25.45\%, and 25.45\% in terms of energy consumption, number of used servers, and average utilization of used servers, respectively. Moreover, from the scalability perspective, the preference of the proposed method for large-scale data centers is more considerable.},

abstract = {Summary Green IT is new way of developing, implementing, and managing computer resources with minimal impact to the environment. Many companies are investing in green technology and practices with the expectation of potentially saving money and making the company more efficient and competitive, besides saving the planet. But like any development, a comprehensive life cycle is required for success. The elements of a life cycle for green IT initiatives are presented in this chapter, starting with strategic planning with an enterprise architecture, moving to the implementation discussing return on investment, metrics and risk management, information assurance, then concluding with a discussion on communication and the impact of social media. A case study demonstrates aspects of the life cycle for a green IT project.}
