abstract = {Smartphones and portable devices have been widely used in our daily life. However, these portable devices cannot be used in a lot of environments due to limitations in battery capacity and computing speed. Therefore, how to save energy consumption and improve processing ability has become a hot issue. The previous works were mainly to transfer some local tasks to remote compute nodes by intelligently selecting the execution route of tasks based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Different from previous work, this work mainly attempts to consider task urgency and system load based on Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) model. Firstly, tasks are given different priorities according to the energy consumption of different locations and task urgency. Secondly, a reference working state is given according to system load to ensure that each task (regardless of job deadline) is completed with minimum energy consumption under the average system load. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is used to schedule tasks on mobile devices and remote cloud resources based on the priority of tasks and reference status of resources. Our method is called AODVFS-Adaptive Offloading based on DVFS model. Comparison with other methods shows that our method saves average energy consumption and increases the number of completed tasks.}

Moreover, the variety of available methods and software tools makes it challenging for non-experts to identify the most appropriate analysis option. This research aims to assist non-experts in selecting the most appropriate set of analysis methods and software tools prior to conducting sustainable engineering analysis (SEA) based on life cycle data accessible to them. A questionnaire-based ranking methodology is developed for non-experts, which reduces their time investment in examining the myriad SEA methods and tools and avoids non-value added effort. The questionnaire uses an interaction matrix within a general mathematical modeling approach to map a given set of methods and tools to user responses. Relevance weights are integrated within the matrix to rank available environmental, economic, and social assessment methods and tools for user consideration. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, a pilot project was conducted to improve the design of a hexacopter. Results were compared using lower- and higher-fidelity software tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the relevance weights assigned to each tool. Assigned weights were determined to enable differentiation between low and high fidelity methods and tools, but as new methods and tools enter into use, these weights must be updated. The process of selecting SEA methods and software gives insight into the utility of the interaction matrix implemented within the tool developed in this research. Moreover, non-experts can compare various design alternatives using the selected analysis methods and software tools to arrive at a solution with improved sustainability performance.}

Smart grid is one of the core energy management system based on multiple routing and data transferring services for energy management, distribution, pricing, and demand services. The traditional energy networks have suffered from high and complex computing operations and lead to degradation of services and the overall performance of all operations. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is one of the platform to enhance the flexibility and efficiency by decoupled the control plane from its data plane. A detachment of these two-planes improved dynamic configuration, controller programmability, centralized and decentralized network operations. In this paper, a distributed SDN approach is used to address the scalability and robustness issues and improve the overall energy efficiency in smart grid systems. The SDN controller logically centralized but it works on multiple nodes that physically distributed. Distributed nodes are communicating with each other and improve the network performance to assist data flow. When flow arrives through end devices to any data plane in distributed SDN, the proposed approach supports the data plane to increase the controller response time. Also, the controller checks, whether the data needs to prioritize flow to send it locally or globally with the help of Elephant or Mice flow. The proposed approach is used to reduce the controller workload, response time, and manage Quality of Services (QoS) and enhanced energy efficiency among controllers. This approach also improves the green energy utilization in smart grid systems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is more suitable and feasible for smart grid systems.}

The unprecedented large-scale growth of energy cloud systems requires a crucial and dramatic paradigm shift in managing and optimizing the available energy assets in order to satisfy the increasing customers’ requirements. This paper proposes and evaluates an edge computing based framework that aims to efficiently manage and optimize energy cloud systems while increasing their reliability, safety, and security. The proposed framework exploits the current expansion in computing capabilities of the edge computing and the Fifth Communication Generation (5G) technology. The evaluation of the proposed framework shows that an edge computing infrastructure improves the service efficiency by 22.6% compared with a cloud infrastructure. In addition, the latency is reduced by 69.1%. The proposed framework provides threat detection capability by using the edge layer as an extra layer for defense against energy cloud system attacks. However, this defense mechanism incurs 10.9% overhead and 9.6% extra delay per service request on average.}

The primary cause of this is dubbed as the unavailability of the proper conduits to efficiently and effectively channel the food waste to the food-deprived population. The eFeed-Hungers is one such globally popular computational framework that provenly addresses these concerns and challenges and smoothly connects the edible food waste to needy.

Further, the required technical artifacts are appropriately implemented to expand the horizon of eFeed-Hungers operations to respond to the global communities with disparate time zones. Additionally, the eFeed-Hungers ecosystem is equipped with the verification and validation system for the incoming food donations to further ensure the consumer’s safely and security.

This paper presents a model-driven engineering approach to optimizing the configuration, energy consumption, and operating cost of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure to create greener computing environments that reduce emissions resulting from superfluous idle resources. The paper provides four contributions to the study of model-driven configuration of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure by (1) explaining how virtual machine configurations can be captured in feature models, (2) describing how these models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for configuration and energy consumption optimization, (3) showing how optimal auto-scaling configurations can be derived from these CSPs with a constraint solver, and (4) presenting a case study showing the energy consumption/cost reduction produced by this model-driven approach.}

abstract = {Purpose
To propose a sustainable model of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) use in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in emergency department (ED) using a partially based teleradiology reporting model. We also analyzed impact of the protocol on short- and long-term patient’s outcome.
Methods
During a 12-month period, 104 consecutive patients admitted to the ED for acute chest pain (ACP) with low-to-intermediate risk of ACS were selected and underwent CCTA. Medical reporting was based on a model combining on-site physician and a remote radiologist supported by a web client-based teleradiology system, covering a 24/7 service. CCTA findings were correlated with the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) over a 5-year follow-up.
Results
CCTA ruled-out CAD in 76 patients (73.1%). Moderate (7.7%) to severe (19.2%) CAD was identified in 28 patients who were directly referred to functional tests or invasive angiography. The mean discharge time was 10.8 ± 5.8 h; patients with absent to mild disease were safely and quickly discharged. Remote reporting using a teleradiology platform was performed in 82/104 cases (78.9%), with slight impact on patient’s discharge time (10.4 ± 5.6 vs. 12.1 ± 6.1 h, p: 0.24). MACEs at 6-month and at 5-year follow-up were 0.96% (n = 1/104) and 15.5% (n = 14/90).
Conclusion
CCTA assessment of patients with ACP enables to quickly rule-out ACS, avoiding waste of time and resources, to identify patients with obstructive CAD which should be referred to subsequent tests and to stratify the risk of MACEs at short and long time. A partial teleradiology based 24/7 CCTA service is feasible and sustainable, even in small ED.}

It is critical to find viable solutions to cloud task scheduling so that cloud resources can be utilized in an energy-efficient way while still meeting diverse user requirements in real time. In this research we propose a Q-learning based task scheduling framework for energy-efficient cloud computing (QEEC). QEEC has two phases. In the first phase a centralized task dispatcher is used to implement the M/M/S queueing model, by which the arriving user requests are assigned to each server in a cloud. In the second phase a Q-learning based scheduler on each server first prioritizes all the requests by task laxity and task life time, then uses a continuously-updating policy to assign tasks to virtual machines, applying incentives to reward the assignments that can minimize task response time and maximize each server’s CPU utilization. We have conducted simulation experiments, which have confirmed that implementing a M/M/S queueing system in a cloud can help to reduce the average task response time. The experiments have also demonstrated that the QEEC approach is the most energy-efficient as compared to other task scheduling policies, which can be largely credited to the M/M/S queueing model and the Q-learning strategy implemented in QEEC.}

Mobile cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm combining cloud computing and mobile networks to alleviate resource-constrained limitations of mobile devices, which can greatly improve network quality of service and efficiency to make good use of available network resource. Mobile cloud computing not only inherits the advantages of strong computing capacity and massive storage of cloud computing, but also overcomes the time and geographical restrictions, bringing benefits for mobile users to offload complex computation to powerful cloud servers for execution anytime and anywhere. To this end, an optimal task workflow scheduling scheme is proposed for the mobile devices, based on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique and the whale optimization algorithm. Through considering three factors: task execution position, task execution sequence, and operating voltage and frequency of mobile devices, this study makes a tradeoff between performance and energy consumption by solving the joint optimization for task completion time and energy consumption simultaneously. Finally, a series of extensive simulation results has demonstrated and verified the scheme has distinguished performance in terms of efficiency and operational cost, providing feasible solutions to similar optimization problems of mobile cloud computing.}

The role of a resource management system is of the greatest importance, principally, if IT companies practice various kinds of sand-boxing technologies, for instance, bare-metal, VMs, containers, and/or nested containers in their datacenters (hybrid platforms). The absence of centralised, workload-aware resource managers and consolidation policies produces questions on datacenters energy efficiency, workloads performance, and users' costs. In this paper, we demonstrate, through several experiments, using the Google workload data for 12,583 hosts and approximately one million tasks that belong to four different kinds of workload, the likelihood of: (i) using workload-aware resource managers in hybrid clouds; (ii) achieving energy and cost savings, in heterogeneous hybrid datacenters such that the workload performance is not affected, negatively; and (iii) how various allocation policies, combined with different migration approaches, will impact on datacenter's energy and performance efficiencies. Using plausible assumptions for hybrid datacenters set-up, our empirical evaluation suggests that, for no migration, a single scheduler is at most 16.86% more energy efficient than distributed schedulers. Moreover, when migrations are considered, our resource manager can save up to 45.61% energy and can improve up to 17.9% workload performance.}

Specifically, cloud-based distributed manufacturing has become a viable service for small and medium companies and prosumers, since it caters to the needs of these stakeholders. Distributed manufacturing offers significant benefits, including reduced cost, shorter lead time, and increased supply-chain flexibility. With interest in these services on the rise, however, there have not been substantial efforts to assess the sustainability performance of cloud-based distributed manufacturing. Sustainability assessment tools are not able to accommodate the unique attributes of cloud-based manufacturing, including broad geographic distribution, real-time autonomous customer support, and dynamic supply chains and processes driven by customer preferences. Thus, this research aims to develop an adaptive sustainability assessment framework for evaluating cloud-based distributed manufacturing systems using an integrated sustainability indicator for environmental, economic, and social impacts. The framework is demonstrated for distributed additive manufacturing as a service.}

Task execution accomplishes by the assemblage of dependent data. This study imparts the dynamic selection of edge cloud for offloading tasks and checks the task’s dependencies in a multiuser, multichannel environment. The proposed dynamic edge server selection for the inter-edge dependent task scheme piles up data from multiple allied edge nodes to finish the execution. This paper employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization technique in the SMEC environment (GAME) to discern the optimal solution.

Presence or absence of a trace element in a system seriously modifies its intrinsic behavior. Cloud point extraction (CPE) is an upcoming technology to preconcentrate and separate many of the trace elements from different chemical and biological systems. The system is sustainable as it involves benign extractants like surfactants and that too at low concentrations at slightly elevated temperatures to form clouds that separate out from the bulk solution. In addition, the extraction behavior of many elements depends on its chemical species. Keeping in view the need to summarize the research encompassing this technique, many review articles were published which cover a selection of the literature published on this topic over several time spans. A myriad of various technological developments has been reported by several workers. These developments have prompted us to revisit the CP technology with a better understanding of its detection, mechanism and extension to species dependent extraction behavior with regard to the state of art determination of trace metals in our day to day applications. The present article summarizes mainly the results of trace metal preconcentration using CP methodology from different practical samples with an insight to the probable mechanism and speciation involved from 2006 onwards.}

Then a two-level hybrid adaptive model was designed to predict the VM load efficiently and accurately, including CPU and memory load.

To address the problem, we present an energy- and traffic-aware ant colony optimization (ETA-ACO) algorithm. Three novel schemes are introduced to enhance the performance of ETA-ACO, including an energy- and bandwidth-aware PM selection scheme, a traffic-based VM ordering scheme, and a direct information exchange scheme. The first scheme consists of two steps when selecting a PM to host a given VM. In the first step, PMs with lower power consumption are preserved. In the second step, the one with the lowest bandwidth resource consumption is chosen to host the VM. In the second scheme, ETA-ACO places VMs in descending order by their traffic demands. The third scheme constructs new solutions by spreading the components of the best solution over a group of constructed solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the three novel schemes are effective in adapting ETA-ACO for the VMP problem. Besides, ETA-ACO outperforms a number of state-of-the-art heuristics and metaheuristics in terms of solution quality.}

abstract = {Energy-efficient resource scheduling has become a hot issue in the field of cloud computing. However, there is an inevitable conflict between energy-saving and QoS optimization. In real-world scenarios, the volatility of cloud task arrival will cause the optimization problem to become more difficult. To achieve a better trade-off between these two goals, a novel resource scheduling framework based on collaborative optimization is proposed for the cloud computing environment. Based on the Lyapunov optimization method, the optimization problem can be solved explicitly in each time slice. We build a multi virtual machine queuing model and analyze the relationships between the task queues’ backlog and the system energy consumption. We also introduce a method of using stacked denoising auto-encoder for extracting the QoS features to improve the constraints of the collaborative optimization objective function. Finally, we propose an efficient resource scheduling strategy to give full play to the processing capabilities of the virtual machine. Experimental results show that, compared with other advanced energy-saving strategies, our scheduling strategy can effectively reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center while guaranteeing QoS, and reduce the total scheduling time cost of data center by more than 20%.}

However, although MEC servers have more computing capability and resources than local, they cannot support the processing of too many user equipment (UE). In contrast, cloud servers have at least several times the computing capability and resources of MEC servers, so they can perform more tasks in parallel and with faster processing speeds. Therefore, the cloud–edge collaborative computing model combines respective advantages of MEC and cloud, and it is thus highly suitable for processing various types of tasks. How to offload tasks to the computing nodes efficiently and allocate resources optimally is an important research question. In this paper, we propose a task offloading and resource allocation algorithm with resource and reliability constraints in the cloud–edge collaborative computing environment. Three computing nodes can be used to process the task data, including UE, the MEC server and the cloud server, and the computing nodes are constrained by their computing capability, resources, and reliability. An online learning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is designed for the objective optimization problem. Through the evaluation and verification of simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is shown to be capable of effectively improving the quality of the user experience and reducing the energy consumption of the system.}

Edge-fog computing has seen significant development in recent years and supports the association of various intelligent things with sensors for establishing smooth data transfer. However, it becomes challenging for edge-fog computing to tackle diverse IoHT settings such as efficient disease management, emergency response management, etc. The key limitation of existing architectures is the restricted scalability and inability to meet the demands of hierarchical computing environments for IoHT. This is because latency-sensitive applications often require large quantities of data to be measured and transferred to the data centers, which causes delay and reduced output. This research proposes a novel edge-fog computing framework for the convergence of machine learning ensemble with edge-fog computing. The proposed architecture delivers healthcare as a fog system that handles data from different sources to manage the diseases effectively. The proposed framework is used for the real-life implementation and automatic detection of gliomas diseases. Glioma is a kind of tumor, which ensues in the spinal cord and a portion of the brain. Glioma instigates in the glial cells that surround the nerve cells. The proposed edge-fog framework efficiently manages the real-time data related to gliomas. This framework is configured for specific operating modes including diverse edge-fog scenarios, different user requirements, quality of service, precision, and predictive accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-time datasets from various sources and experimentally tested with reliable datasets that disclose the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of power consumption, latency, accuracy, and execution time, respectively.}

Cloud computing services are hosted in Cloud Data Centers (CDC) that deploy thousands of computation, storage, and communication devices leading to high energy utilization and carbon emissions. Renewable energy resources replace fossil fuels based grid energy to effectively reduce carbon emissions of CDCs. Moreover, waste heat generated from electronic components can be utilized in absorption based cooling systems to offset cooling costs of data centers. However, data centers need to be located at ideal geographical locations to reap benefits of renewable energy and waste heat recovery options. Modular Data Centers (MDC) can enable energy as a location paradigm due to their shippable nature. Moreover, workload can be transferred between intelligently placed geographically dispersed data centers to utilize renewable energy available elsewhere with virtual machine migration techniques. However, adoption of aforementioned sustainability techniques and technologies opens new challenges, such as, intermittency of power supply from renewable resources and higher capital costs. In this paper, we examine sustainable CDCs from various aspects to survey the enabling techniques and technologies. We present case studies from both academia and industry that demonstrate favorable results for sustainability measures in CDCs. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art research in sustainable CDCs.

We built a prototype of the 5GUKEx and evaluated its performance through emulations showing that the 5GUKEx introduces minimum overhead.

abstract = {Virtual machine (VM) migration is an indispensable aspect of a virtualized cloud environment. It assists in resource management by dynamically relocating VMs from one physical machine to another. This is an essential aspect especially for big data applications that are prone to variable workloads and often demand relocation of resources in terms of VMs. However, such applications not only experience stochastic workloads but also have stringent requirements on the maximum tolerable latency. To address such issues, VMs are often relocated using live VM migration. VM migration is associated with overheads, hence, in this paper, we propose a modified serial migration strategy to migrate multiple VMs based on the pre-copy live migration technique. We propose to interleave the pre-copy stages in such a way that a balance is achieved between the migration time and downtime overheads. The proposed technique is compared with the state-of-the-art serial, parallel, and improved serial migration strategies. Concerning downtime, the proposed approach performs exceptionally well compared to both serial and improved serial methods. The downtime of the proposed scheme and parallel are comparative for read-intensive applications (low dirtying rates). However, for write-intensive applications (high dirtying rates) the former significantly outperforms the latter. The migration time performance of the proposed scheme is observed to be much better than that of the parallel technique and is slightly higher than those of serial and improved serial techniques.}

abstract = {In virtualized cloud computing systems, energy reduction is a serious concern since it can offer many major advantages, such as reducing running costs, increasing system efficiency, and protecting the environment. At the same time, an energy-efficient task scheduling strategy is a viable way to meet these goals. Unfortunately, mapping cloud resources to user requests to achieve good performance by minimizing the energy consumption of cloud resources within a user-defined deadline is a huge challenge. This paper proposes Energy and Performance-Efficient Task Scheduling Algorithm (EPETS) in a heterogeneous virtualized cloud to resolve the issue of energy consumption. There are two stages in the proposed algorithm: initial scheduling helps to reduce execution time and satisfy task deadlines without considering energy consumption, and the second stage task reassignment scheduling to find the best execution location within the deadline limit with less energy consumption. Moreover, to make a reasonable balance between task scheduling and energy saving, we suggest an energy-efficient task priority system. The simulation results show that, compared to current energy-efficient scheduling methods of RC-GA, AMTS, and E-PAGA, the proposed solution helps to reduce significant energy consumption and improve performance by 5%–20% with deadline constraint satisfied.}

Existing dew-based systems lack an opportunistic architecture of data-synchronization with the cloud. This paper proposes a model that makes efficient use of IoT and cloud-dew architecture for a sustainable health monitoring system. Wireless sensor nodes are used to monitor the biosignals dynamically. All accrued data is temporarily stored in the dew layer. It is synchronized with the cloud at a subsequent phase to achieve seamless accessibility and optimal scalability of the data. Data synchronization plays an essential role in the cloud dew framework. We have used the Gini index and Shannon entropy to ensure intelligent data synchronization with the cloud. Sometimes sensors produce erroneous data, which poses a significant threat to the sustainable health monitoring system. Fuzzy normal distribution with a triangular membership function has been used to clean up the data and filter out the outliers. Further, we compared the proposed MedGini model with the existing models and analyzed the system performance. MedGini is found to outperform others concerning cost and power consumption.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aimed to perform a longitudinal analysis of the performance of our automated plan checking software by retrospectively evaluating the number of errors identified in plans delivered to patients in 3, month-long, data collection periods between 2017 and 2020.
Methods and Materials
Eleven automated checks were retrospectively run on 1169 external beam radiation therapy treatment plans identified as meeting the following criteria: planning target volume–based multifield photon plans receiving a status of treatment approved in March 2017, March 2018, or March 2020. The number of passes (true positives) and flags were recorded. Flags were subcategorized into false negatives, false negatives due to naming conventions, and true negatives. In addition, 2 × 2 contingency tables using a 2-tailed Fisher's exact test were used to determine whether there were nonrandom associations between the output of the automated plan checking software and whether the check was manual or automated at the original time of treatment approval.
Results
A statistically significant decrease in flags between the pre- and postautomation data sets was observed for 4 contour-based checks, namely adjacent structures overlap, empty structures and missing slices, overlap between body and couch, and laterality, as well as a check that determined whether the plan's global maximum dose was within the planning target volume. A review of the origins of false negatives was fed back into the design of the checks to improve the reliability of the system and help avoid warning fatigue.
Conclusions
Periodic and longitudinal review of the performance of automated software was essential for monitoring and understanding its impact on error rates, as well as for optimization of the tool to adapt to regular changes of clinical practice. The automated plan checking software has demonstrated continuous contributions to the safe and effective delivery of external beam radiation therapy to our patient population, an impact that extends beyond its initial implementation and deployment.}

The guifi.net community network is a successful example of a digital infrastructure, a computer network, managed as an open commons. Inspired by the guifi.net case and its commons governance model, we claim that a computing cloud, another digital infrastructure, can also be managed as an open commons if the appropriate tools are put in place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons.}

In this approach, we mention primarily some of the main risk examples in terms of cloud architecture layers and the developing optimization model of cloud risk appetite. We use a risk map that indicates the severity of each individual risk, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) as risk constraints and evaluation criteria, and linear programming for final fuzzy optimization calculation to gain risk acceptance amount for a given organization in regard to each cloud’s predefined risk.

abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been increasingly used in environmental and urban studies due to its cloud-based geospatial processing capability and accessibility to a large collection of geospatial datasets like Landsat, Modis, etc. However, at present, ecological and urban modeling efforts based on GEE are facing three grave challenges: current illustrations of GEE are to a large extent “straightforward mapping” applications; technical complexities that ecological or urban modelers have to overcome in order to effectively and easily use GEE to develop image processing based environmental models; and the majority of ecological and urban modelers are not aware of new analytical approaches that are becoming available because of the unprecedent geospatial processing capability and large collection of big geospatial datasets GEE has brought to them. The great potential of GEE to support ecological and urban modeling is less explored. In this study, we augmented GEE functions with a few sets of user-customized functions for improving image classification accuracy, estimating ecosystem services, and modeling urban growth sustainability. The paper is the first effort of modeling urban sustainability based on the concept of ecosystem service value (ESV) and in the cloud with GEE; is the first application of classifying GEE Landsat time-series images to compute yearly ESV; and creates the first set of cloud tools to augment GEE for ecologists and urban modelers to model urban sustainability from GEE and ESV. The paper also chose Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia as a case study to model urban sustainability in a time-series 12 years (2005–2016). The case study successfully estimated ecosystem service values and analyzed urban growth sustainability. It also revealed spatial disparities and temporal dynamics of urban growth sustainability in Hohhot City. The study provides an easy-to-adapt illustration on using GEE for image-based ecological and urban modeling.}

To improve the practicability of ETSTM, we provide a software energy consumption function based on software characteristic fitting by a backpropagation (BP) neural network, which can be used to predict software energy consumption. Furthermore, we provide two types of energy consumption analysis algorithms based on explicit execution path search and bounded model checking (BMC) for ETSTM. The experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve good performance.}

The proposed approach utilizes per-core Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on the underlying heterogeneous multi-core processors, as well as approximate computations, in order to fill in schedule gaps. At the same time, it takes into account the effects of input error on the processing time of the component tasks. Our goal is to provide timeliness and energy efficiency by trading off result precision, while keeping the result quality of the completed jobs at an acceptable standard and the monetary cost required for the execution of the jobs at a reasonable level. The proposed scheduling heuristic is compared to two other baseline policies, under the impact of various QoS requirements.

In contrast to legacy energy conservation approaches, we aim at energy-synchronized computing for wireless sensor devices. The starting point of this work is TwinStar, which uses ultra-capacitor as the only energy storage unit. To efficiently use the harvested energy, we design and implement leakage-aware feedback control techniques to match the activities of sensor nodes with dynamic energy supply from environments. We conduct system evaluation under both indoor and outdoor typical real-world settings. Results indicate our leakage-aware energy-synchronized control can effectively utilize energy that could otherwise leak away.}

abstract = {Data-driven modeling for wastewater treatment process (WWTP) under hybrid cloud environment, has been widely regarded as a promising solution. Existing methods managed to learn a forward mapping for WWTP, and were highly reliable on rich intermediate process parameters (IPP) such as dissolved oxygen amount. However, they cannot well handle scenes where IPP are unavailable. In fact, such situations are quite common because many wastewater treatment plants still lack relevant monitoring systems. To remedy such gap, this research collected real-world data from wastewater treatment plants to build realistic experimental scenarios. On this foundation, a probabilistic model for WWTP, named Pro-WWTP for short, is proposed in this paper. More concretely, generative processes of outlet results are expressed as conditional probability, and IPP are estimated via Gibbs sampling-based Bayesian posterior probabilistic inference. Empirically, we conduct two groups of experiments to evaluate proactivity of the proposed Pro-WWTP. Experimental results reveal that Pro-WWTP possesses proper recovery precision for IPP and is able to promote modeling efficiency. Besides, another group of experiments are further implemented to verify total robustness of Pro-WWTP.}

abstract = {In a cloud-based cyber–physical system, many jobs consist of multiple parallel tasks. The cloud system usually adopts active task replication to improve performance and guarantee the reliability of a job. This technology creates redundant replicas for each task and then executes the replicas concurrently. In the cloud system, each replica is a virtual machine (VM) image that can be easily assigned to different physical machines (PMs) to overcome resource heterogeneity. However, how to design a rational task replication strategy (including replica creation and VM assignment) is indeed a complex issue. It should comprehensively consider correlations and tradeoffs among reliability, performance, and energy consumption. This paper first proposes a reliability–performance correlation model for a job executed by using active task replication. We design a general method to avoid analyzing complex failure correlations and give a Bayesian approach to calculate the performability metric of the job. The paper also proposes a reliability–energy correlation model to evaluate random energy consumption of a PM hosting multiple VMs by using mixed random variables. Finally, an expected net profit optimization model and a genetic algorithm are developed to search for an optimal task replication strategy balancing tradeoffs among reliability, performance, and energy consumption. Illustrative examples are provided.}

Vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure have been readily exploited by the adversary class. Therefore, providing the desired level of assurance to all stakeholders through safeguarding data (sensitive or otherwise) which is stored in the cloud, is of utmost importance. In addition, protecting the cloud from adversarial attacks of diverse types and intents, cannot be understated. Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack is considered as one of the concerns that has stalled many organizations from migrating their operations and/or data to the cloud. This is because an EDoS attack targets the financial component of the service provider. In this work, we propose a novel and reactive approach based on a rate limit technique, with low overhead, to detect and mitigate EDoS attacks against cloud-based services. Through this reactive scheme, a limited access permission for cloud services is granted to each user. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory cloud setup, to evaluate the performance of the proposed mitigation technique. Results obtained show that the proposed approach is able to detect and prevent such an attack with low cost and overhead.}

Therefore, creating a balanced computing environment via the offloading process is the key. However, there are many obstacles to balance computing nodes in the fog environment, such as offloading strategy and its consequences due to the extreme offloading processes, and when need to offload and where. These obstacles are vital concerns among researchers. Thus, several studies have been conducted to enhance the fog system performance to increase the entire system’s throughput. This paper explores the recent articles to determine the possible research gaps and opportunities to implement an efficient solution for load balancing in fog environments after analyzing and assessing the existing solutions. While most of the proposed solutions involve short-term solution, this literature review reveals the need to find out a sustainable resolution for load balancing to avoid listed obstacles by using the offloading technique with maintaining the bandwidth of the network.}

Besides, anomalies may occur occasionally in most applications, while the majority of time durations may correspond to a healthy situation. In this setting, the range, rather than an accurate value of sensory data, should be more interesting to domain applications, and the range is represented as the category of sensory data in this paper. To decrease the energy consumption of IoT networks, this paper proposes an energy-efficient sensory data gathering mechanism, where the category of sensory data is processed by adopting the compressed sensing algorithm. The sensory data are forecasted through a data prediction model in the cloud, and sensory data of an IoT node is necessary to be routed to the cloud for the synchronization purpose, only when the category provided by this IoT node is different from the category of the forecasted value in the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques, in terms of the network traffic and energy consumption.}

All scientific approaches have in common that flexible intralogistics production networks require an autonomous and intelligent transportation systems that is not designed for a specific task, but can take on different transport roles due to their versatility. However, a comprehensive analysis of current designs and research projects in the field of AGVs and intralogistics transport robots show that there is neither the necessary interoperability of different systems nor a system architecture that addresses a flexible material flow independent of the physical design of the transportation system. AGVs mainly have a central control system, which manages the generation of transport orders and their disposition on the vehicles. In addition, the routes are specified centrally for the vehicles, even if they have free navigation. The individual transport unit is therefore only an executing machine that processes the assigned transport orders without any influence on order dispatching or route planning. Therefore, these AGV approaches do not have the flexibility and autonomy required for an intralogistics production network. The research project addresses the necessary interoperability of logistics systems and the abandonment of proprietary standalone solutions. For this purpose, methods for digitizing the workspace, route planning and path execution using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) were developed. A central component of this architecture is the approach described in the paper to enable decentralized path planning on the vehicles. Therefore, the path planning must be applicable to different target platforms without implementation effort and the vehicle software must be designed independently of the application. This approach allows intralogistics systems to be flexible and adaptable, resulting in a more sustained use of these systems.}

An extensive utilization of CC and virtualization technologies has resulted in the development of large-scale data centers which spend massive quantity of energy and have significant carbon footprints. Since 3% of global electricity is being consumed by the data centers in the present world, energy efficiency becomes a major issue in data centres and cloud computing. At the same time, resource allocation finds useful in CC to effectively utilize the available computing resources in the network for facilitating the processing of complex task which necessitate large-scale processing. In this view, this paper presents new hybrid metaheuristics for energy efficiency resource allocation (HMEERA) for the CCC environment. The proposed model initially performs the feature extraction process based on the task demands from many clients and feature reduction process takes place using principal component analysis (PCA). Then, the integrated features are used by the HMEERA technique for optimal resource allocation. The HMEERA model involves the hybridization of the Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm (GTOA) with rat swarm optimizer (RSO) algorithm, called GTOA-RSO for optimal resource allocation. The integration of GTOA and RSO algorithms assist to improve the allocation of resources among VMs in cloud datacenter. For experimental validation, a comprehensive set of simulations were performed using CloudSim tool. The experimental results showcased the superior performance of the HMEERA model interms of different aspects.}

Users benefit from the pay-as-you-go model by saving expenditures and service providers are deploying their services to cloud data centers to reduce their maintenance efforts. However, due to the fast growth of cloud data centers, the energy consumed by the data centers can lead to a huge amount of carbon emission with environmental impacts, and the carbon intensity of different locations are varied among different power plants according to the sources of energy. Thus, in this paper, to address the carbon emission problem of data centers, we consider shifting the workloads among multi-cloud located in different time zones. We also formulate the energy usage and carbon emission of data centers and model the solar power corresponding to the locations. This helps to reduce the usage of brown energy and maximize the utilization of renewable energy at different locations. We propose an approach for managing carbon footprint and renewable energy for multiple data centers at California, Virginia, and Dublin, which are in different time zones. The results show that our proposed approaches that apply workload shifting can reduce around 40% carbon emission in comparison to the baseline while ensuring the average response time of user requests.}

abstract = {The workload generated by the Internet of Things (IoT)-based infrastructure is often handled by the cloud data centers (DCs). However, in recent time, an exponential increase in the deployment of the IoT-based infrastructure has escalated the workload on the DCs. So, these DCs are not fully capable to meet the strict demand of IoT devices in regard to the lower latency as well as high data rate while provisioning IoT workloads. Therefore, to reinforce the latency-sensitive workloads, an intersection layer known as edge computing has successfully balanced the entire service provisioning landscape. In this IoT-edge-cloud ecosystem, large number of interactions and data transmissions among different layer can increase the load on underlying network infrastructure. So, software-defined edge computing has emerged as a viable solution to resolve these latency-sensitive workload issues. Additionally, energy consumption has been witnessed as a major challenge in resource-constrained edge systems. The existing solutions are not fully compatible in Software-defined Edge ecosystem for handling IoT workloads with an optimal trade-off between energy-efficiency and latency. Hence, this article proposes a lightweight and energy-efficient container-as-a-service (CaaS) approach based on the software-define edge computing to provision the workloads generated from the latency-sensitive IoT applications. A Stackelberg game is formulated for a two-period resource allocation between end-user/IoT devices and Edge devices considering the service level agreement. Furthermore, an energy-efficient ensemble for container allocation, consolidation and migration is also designed for load balancing in software-defined edge computing environment. The proposed approach is validated through a simulated environment with respect to CPU serve time, network serve time, overall delay, lastly energy consumption. The results obtained show the superiority of the proposed in comparison to the existing variants.}

Cloud computing (CC), which possesses large capacity in terms of computing and storage resource, may not be suitable for many vehicular applications like safety and emergency services due to high bandwidth requirement and large response time. Edge or fog computing can be a promising technology that can be integrated with vehicular networks to meet the requirements of less bandwidth usage and lower response time. Vehicular cloud network (VCN) extends cloud computing concepts among the vehicles in the vehicular networks to enable vehicles with excess computing, storage or bandwidth capacities to share the resources with other vehicles, who are willing to use that extra resource to fulfill their service requirements. Security poses a great challenge in a vehicular network due to high mobility, dynamic and frequent changes in topology and sudden variation in vehicle density in the roads. Privacy of the vehicular users must be ensured to encourage mass participation for making the system trustworthy. Both security and privacy are pre-requisites of a sustainable smart city. For secured service provisioning, before transmitting a message, connected vehicles must be authenticated. In this paper, we have proposed a system to authenticate vehicles for secured service provisioning in edge-enabled vehicular cloud networks. A novel technique has been developed to avoid redundant authentication to validate a vehicle successively across various RSUs (road side units). Extensive simulation works have been done and the outputs demonstrate efficacy of the proposed algorithm.}

Yet consortia undertaking such collaborative efforts struggle to balance the oft-competing demands of innovation and sustainability. Drawing upon a longitudinal case study of the Kuali initiative, this analysis examines the mechanisms of exploration and exploitation involved in developing and sustaining a COSS approach. Based on our findings in the Kuali case, we develop a conceptual framework to discern whether and how COSS development initiatives can achieve contextual ambidexterity, balancing the strategic goals of innovation and sustainability over time. While exploration- and exploitation-oriented efforts compete for resources, our analysis reveals that they may also complement one another across distinct layers of institutional activity. The contextual ambidexterity is achieved through multi-level collaboration enabled by a modular technical and organizational design.}

Firstly, we build an energy consumption evaluation model, analyze the correlation between independent variables and dependent variables through multiple linear regression model and multiple nonlinear regression model, and then measure the accuracy of the evaluation results by using average relative deviation and relative deviation; The depth learning mechanism is introduced, and the depth residual network is used for iterative training of regression parameters to complete the mapping of regression parameters; Comprehensively obtain the regression parameters in the energy consumption model, put them into the memory playback pool, solve the energy consumption evaluation function according to the sub strategy parameters, and reconstruct the energy consumption model of cloud computing data center. The comprehensive evaluation of energy consumption of cloud computing data center is realized. The experimental results show that the energy consumption deviation of this method is small and stable. It can effectively reduce the relative error of evaluation power change and reduce the evaluation training loss.}

abstract = {The importance of information and communication technology (ICT) sector on the global energy consumption and CO2 emissions tend to grow. ICTs have a fundamental role in collaborating for a sustainable development by providing services in an efficient way, however, its own structure should also follow sustainable principles, for instance, by consuming lower energy amount. The quest for sustainability of ICTs has been focused on data centers (DC) optimization through techniques of sharing infra-structures, which would result in energy efficiency increase, carbon footprint reduction, and reduction of e-waste material disposal. In this scenario, the cloud computing technique rises as the most promising one, often receiving the “green” label. However, this label is usually based on electricity consumption reduction and disregards several other important “green” label-related aspects. This work uses emergy accounting (spelled with an “m”) and direct energy consumption in calculating indicators of eco-energy efficiency for DC operating under traditional and cloud computing techniques. A traditional decentralized DC and a centralized cloud computing DC are herein considered for illustrating figures and for discussion. Results show that centralized DC is able to provide a virtual machine (VM) by demanding 51% less electricity than decentralized DC, and it consumes 87% less electricity to store a byte. Under an emergy accounting perspective, the centralized DC demands 45% less global resources than the decentralized DC to provide a VM while demanding 85% less global resources to store a byte. Although the assessed indicators point out better eco-energy efficiency performance for the DC using cloud computing techniques, labeling it as “green” could be considered as premature due to a lack of threshold which allows for categorizing a system as “green”. Nevertheless, the centralized DC evaluated should be promoted due to its better performance as for the considered indicators.}

An expanded set of urban sustainability goals also includes increasing carbon sequestration, songbird habitat, reducing urban heat island effects, and improvement of landscape aesthetics. GI is conceptualized to improve water and ecosystem quality by reducing storm water runoff at the source, but when properly designed, may also benefit these expanded goals. With the increasing use of GI in urban contexts, there is an emerging need to facilitate participatory design and scenario evaluation to enable better communication between GI designers and groups impacted by these designs. Major barriers to this type of public participation is the complexity of both parameterizing, operating, visualizing and interpreting results of complex ecohydrological models at various watershed scales that are sufficient to address diverse ecosystem service goals. This paper demonstrates a set of workflows to facilitate rapid and repeatable creation of GI landscape designs which are incorporated into complex models using web applications and services. For this project, we use the RHESSys (Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System) ecohydrologic model to evaluate participatory GI landscape designs generated by stakeholders and decision makers, but note that the workflow could be adapted to a set of other watershed models.}

One is the conflict between fuel economy optimization and battery state of health preservation, and the other is the conflict between global optimality and real-time capability. Inspired by the hierarchy structure of a computer, a two-layer internet-distributed EMS (ID-EMS) is developed using cloud computing and the internet of vehicles. The top layer in the cloud, which possesses powerful calculating capability, focuses on global optimality by utilizing machine learning technology and stochastic dynamic programming. The bottom layer on board, with limited computing power, employs a fuzzy controller to respond to real-time conditions while trying not to deviate too far from the global solution. Thus, a real-time global optimal EMS can be achieved. The ID-EMS is implemented on an internet-distributed vehicle-in-the-loop simulation platform whose in-loop vehicle makes it possible to test the ID-EMS in an on-road driving experiment. The ID-EMS outperforms a rule-based EMS in terms of overall cost by 6.8%, but it is surpassed by an acausal EMS with dynamic programming by 7%. These results suggest directions for the future development of EMS for PHEVs using cloud computing.}

Here, we focus on the Cloud virtual machine (VM) scheduling that is usually based on simple algorithms, e.g. VM placement on nodes with low memory usage. This approach fails to consider the actual configuration of nodes inside the server rack resulting in local overheating of Cloud data centres. To solve this, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the gravitational effect, called VMSAGE, to optimize energy efficiency of Cloud computing systems. Inspired by the physical gravitation model, we define the thermal repulsion and logical gravitation factors between physical nodes and VMs. To achieve optimized VM scheduling, we propose a gravitation function that refers to the calculation of the logical quality of each VM, host and rack through the algorithm, so as to draw the attractiveness between them. Based on the concept of dimension reduction, VMSAGE conducts the two-dimensional plane target selection twice to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, VMSAGE evaluates attributes of the computer room to carry out the VM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution, we compare it with the Best Fit Heuristic (BFH) and the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithm achieves 10% and 20% optimized energy consumption respectively. The experimental results highlight our contribution, in where VMSAGE can significantly reduce energy consumption rates and VM migration times.}

abstract = {The workload of cloud providers is often uncertain due to the dynamic and varied client demands, thus presenting a significant challenge. If cloud providers fail to meet changing demands during peak hours, they may experience service requests’ delays and rejections, damaging both their reputation and their profit margin. The idea of cloud federations is contemplated as a solution to this challenge by allowing a group of cloud providers to combine their resources, as and when required, to satisfy client requests dynamically. Despite the merits of the existing cloud federation approaches, they suffer from several limitations, such as performance issues, the inability to converge to a solution in complex scenarios, the lack of consideration of SLA requirements during the federation formation phase, and the lack of flexibility offered to clients to prioritize specific objectives during the formation of the cloud federation. This work addresses these deficiencies by presenting a green, practical, and customizable SLA-based approach to cloud federation formation. Inspired by social gaming, the proposed approach can rapidly form a stable coalition of cloud providers able to fulfill client requests, while ensuring the satisfaction of SLA requirements in terms of performance, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and providers’ trustfulness. At the heart of this approach lies a new coalition formation algorithm, dubbed the “multi-criterion coalition formation algorithm (MCCF).” Unlike existing collation formation algorithms, the MCCF algorithm offers clients the flexibility to prioritize the objectives used for cloud federation formation. Based on those preferences, the MCCF algorithm generates stable SLA-aware groups of cloud providers that dynamically adapt to network changes using a self-healing process. The MCCF algorithm has been implemented and extensively tested using a wide range of scenarios, and its performance was compared with that of two state of the art approaches: The optimal approach and the split-and-merge approach. The results show that the MCCF algorithm outperforms the optimal and the split-and-merge approaches in terms of coalition size, individual providers’ payoff, and mistrust cost. Moreover, the proposed approach yields a zero % request rejection rate and an execution time that is 8 to 16 times faster than the split-and-merge and optimal approaches, while enabling a reduction of the Carbon footprint of the cloud coalition operations. Owing to these advantages and its ability to offer a flexible and customizable solution to clients, the MCCF algorithm represents a promising and environmentally conscious cloud collation formation approach that is ideal for real-time applications and practical cloud deployments.}

A novel framework integrating System Dynamics (SD) and Granular Computing (GrC) is proposed to estimate the long-term impacts of tunnel infrastructure development on urban sustainability. An integrated system, consisting of social, economic, and environmental sub-systems, is developed to model urban sustainability. A comprehensive method that integrates Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and entropy weighting methods is proposed to provide a more reliable and objective way to sort information and identify the weight of each criterion. The SD model is established to interpret the relationships of the sub-systems and predict future development. The GrC approach is employed to model and reveal the uncertainties in the SD model and improve reliability. A project case is selected to verify the proposed approach. The results show that the economic system (S2) has better performance than the other two systems, namely social (S1) and environmental systems (S3), which indicates the development of metro lines can boost economic growth. The long-term impact of tunnel infrastructure development on urban sustainability fluctuates over time. The developed approach can be used as a decision tool to assess and estimate the long-term impacts of tunnel infrastructure development on urban sustainability with the consideration of uncertainties in factor measurement and provide decision support for enhancing sustainable urban development.}

There are three specific features regarding this framework. First, a transportation cloud is built for the storage of massive data and video. This cloud-based system not only avoids the use of hard disks at client-site for energy conservation and reliability improvement, but also allows the back-end data analytics at both server and client sites. Second, a real-time traffic condition analytic was developed by mobile machine vision techniques based on video and data collected from road-side cameras to analyze and recognize traffic conditions, such as traffic flow, braking events, traffic lights, and count-down timers. Then, a fuel-efficient route navigation technology is also developed for eco-driving based on real time traffic information and a dynamic shortest path algorithm for saving time and fuel consumption. Third, a sequential pattern mining model was proposed to diagnose misguided driving behavior for eco-driving based on the real-time data collected from digital tachygraphy and on-board diagnostics system. Furthermore, an e-Learning visualization system was developed to provide advice and instruction for correction of misguided driving behavior. Indeed, the fuel consumption and power consumption can be reduced simultaneously based on the proposed framework regarding cloud-based system and eco-driving.}

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed, which identifies SSCM practices as the evaluation criteria for supplier evaluation. Because vague and subjective information often exists in decision-making of supplier evaluation, fuzzy-based approaches are frequently used to manipulate such vagueness and subjectivity. However, the previous fuzzy methods do not consider randomness in decision making and they require prior information. Thus, an extended TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method is developed in this paper for sustainable supplier selection, which integrates the advantage of cloud model theory in manipulating uncertainty of randomness (intrapersonal uncertainty) and the merit of rough set theory in flexibly handling interpersonal uncertainty without extra information. Additionally, an integrated weighting method considering both subjective and objective weights is proposed to determine comprehensive weights of criteria. Finally, a case study of sustainable photovoltaic modules supplier selection is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

This increase in service demands in smart cities will result in escalating energy consumption in cloud datacenters. Such a rise in energy consumption will result in upsurge of operational costs and emission of greenhouse gases. In this work, a green cloud computing algorithm named “Cost-based Energy Efficient Scheduling Technique for Dynamic Volage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) Systems (CEEST)” is proposed. The proposed algorithm reduces energy consumption without compromising the quality of service (QoS). The goal of this algorithm is optimization and management of servers in the datacenters by utilizing maximum resources of the servers and powering off the underutilized servers. CEEST utilizes the scaling of virtual machines to finish jobs in the deadlines to reduce violations of service level agreement (SLA). Simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of execution time, energy consumption, resource utilization, and SLA violations. The proposed algorithm saves energy up to 30% in comparison to existing algorithms. The utilization of resources is also significantly increased by to 30%. In terms of SLA violations, the proposed algorithm reduced SLA violations up to 50%.}

abstract = {As the sizes of IT infrastructure continue to grow, cloud computing is a natural extension of virtualisation technologies that enable scalable management of virtual machines over a plethora of physically connected systems. The so-called virtualisation-based cloud computing paradigm offers a practical approach to green IT/clouds, which emphasise the construction and deployment of scalable, energy-efficient network software applications (NetApp) by virtue of improved utilisation of the underlying resources. The latter is typically achieved through increased sharing of hardware and data in a multi-tenant cloud architecture/environment and, as such, accentuates the critical requirement for enhanced security services as an integrated component of the virtual infrastructure management strategy. This paper analyses the key security challenges faced by contemporary green cloud computing environments, and proposes a virtualisation security assurance architecture, CyberGuarder, which is designed to address several key security problems within the ‘green’ cloud computing context. In particular, CyberGuarder provides three different kinds of services; namely, a virtual machine security service, a virtual network security service and a policy based trust management service. Specifically, the proposed virtual machine security service incorporates a number of new techniques which include (1) a VMM-based integrity measurement approach for NetApp trusted loading, (2) a multi-granularity NetApp isolation mechanism to enable OS user isolation, and (3) a dynamic approach to virtual machine and network isolation for multiple NetApp’s based on energy-efficiency and security requirements. Secondly, a virtual network security service has been developed successfully to provide an adaptive virtual security appliance deployment in a NetApp execution environment, whereby traditional security services such as IDS and firewalls can be encapsulated as VM images and deployed over a virtual security network in accordance with the practical configuration of the virtualised infrastructure. Thirdly, a security service providing policy based trust management is proposed to facilitate access control to the resources pool and a trust federation mechanism to support/optimise task privacy and cost requirements across multiple resource pools. Preliminary studies of these services have been carried out on our iVIC platform, with promising results. As part of our ongoing research in large-scale, energy-efficient/green cloud computing, we are currently developing a virtual laboratory for our campus courses using the virtualisation infrastructure of iVIC, which incorporates the important results and experience of CyberGuarder in a practical context.}

In addition, the emerging concept of Cloud federation allows providers to optimize the utilization of their resources establishing business partnerships. In this scenario, the massive exploitation of ICT solutions is increasing the energy consumption of providers, thus many researchers are currently investigating new energy management strategies. Nevertheless, balancing Quality of Service (QoS) with both energy sustainability and cost saving concepts is not trivial at all. The growing interest in this area has been highlighted by the increasing number of contributions that are appearing in literature. Currently, most of energy management strategies are specifically focused on independent Cloud providers, others are beginning to look at Cloud federation. In this paper, we present a survey that helps researchers to identify the future trends of energy management in Cloud federation. In particular, we select the major contributions dealing with energy sustainability and cost-saving strategies aimed at Cloud computing and federation and we present a taxonomy useful to analyze the current state-of-the-art. In the end, we highlight possible directions for future research efforts.}

This paper introduces an improved Analytic Hierarchy Process-based Normal cloud model which incorporated randomness and fuzziness and presents an index system applicable to empirical analysis on 31 provinces of China. The weight system of evaluation indicators is determined by an improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) approach with good accessibility and attainability. Regional disparities of resources sustainability are demonstrated by spatial distributions of mineral resources sustainability with the help of GIS technology. The sustainability level is determined by the combination of resources, environment and society dimensions. The results indicate that the areas with high sustainability do not necessarily happen in resource-rich regions. The most important implications are the relatively lower sustainability of the developed areas and the higher sustainability in western provinces. The scores for indicators reveal that compared with western and central areas, the coastal provinces are less sustainable in environmental carrying capacity, but with higher sustainable social supporting capacity. Robustness test notes that the results are sensitive to the adjustment of weight system due to the preference of decision makers. Finally, differentiated regional strategies for improving overall sustainability are proposed.}

To our knowledge there is no other study that has analysed the interactions between regulatory policies, such as the coal cess, and technological progress in low carbon technologies, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), for achieving a target. The main conclusions emerging from the analysis are – first, endogenous technological change in renewables under current level of carbon pricing (coal cess) can help to achieve the low carbon target along with economic gains; second, the coal cess can facilitate the shift towards a low carbon economy by decreasing the relative prices of non-fossil fuel energy and being a source of finance for supporting R&D in renewables; and finally, advances in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology can help to achieve CO2 emission reduction at a lower economic cost. Thus, besides technology and fund transfers from advanced economies, policy focus on R&D in energy technologies and carbon pricing are required to take Indian economy on a low carbon growth path.}

abstract = {Cloud Manufacturing (CM) is a service oriented business model to share manufacturing capabilities and resources on a cloud platform. Manufacturing is under pressure to achieve cost and environmental impact reductions, as manufacturing becomes more integrated and complex. Cloud manufacturing offers a solution, as it is capable of making intelligent decisions to provide the most sustainable and robust manufacturing route available. Although CM research has progressed, a consensus is still lacking on the concepts within CM as well as applications and scope beyond discrete manufacturing. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how CM offers a more sustainable manufacturing future to the industry as a whole, before focusing specifically on the application to process manufacturing (e.g. food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals). This paper details the definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on CM. From this, the fundamental aspects of the CM concept are identified, along with an analysis of how the concept has progressed. A new, comprehensive CM definition is formulated by combining key concepts drawn from previous definitions and emphasizes CM potential for sustainable manufacturing. Four key methods of how CM increases sustainability are identified: (1) collaborative design; (2) greater automation; (3) improved process resilience and (4) enhanced waste reduction, reuse and recovery. The first two key methods are common to both discrete and process manufacturing, however key methods (3) and (4) are more process manufacturing specific and application of CM for these has yet to be fully realised. Examples of how CM’s characteristics may be utilised to solve various process manufacturing problems are presented to demonstrate the applications of CM to process manufacturing. Waste is an important consideration in manufacturing, with strong sustainability implications. The current focus has been on using CM for waste minimisation; however, process manufacturing offers waste as a resource (valorisation opportunities from diversifying co-products, reuse, recycle and energy recovery). Exploring CM’s potential to characterise and evaluate alternative process routes for the valorisation of process manufacturing waste is considered for the first time. The specific limitations preventing CM adoption by process manufacturers are discussed. Finally, CM’s place in the future of manufacturing is explored, including how it will interact with, and complement other emerging manufacturing technologies to deliver a circular economy and personalised products.}

abstract = {Cloud computing has seen rapid growth in the last decade, as a result of this there is an increasing concern about the energy requirement of cloud data centres. One approach to tackle this issue is dynamic virtual machine consolidation (DVMC) where virtual machines (VMs) are packed into fewer hosts, while hosts which have no VMs are placed into a hibernate mode. DVMC is traditionally solved with strategies that build on centralised topologies. One disadvantage of these solutions is that they don′t scale well in very large data centres as the manager node becomes a bottleneck and a single point of failure. The nature of the problem lends itself to a decentralised solution which is preferred over a centralised one when a problem is: inherently modular, large in scale, in a very dynamic environment, and when communication channels can experience message delays and loss. We propose Gossip Contracts (GC), a new multi-agent framework for crafting decentralised co-operation strategies. GC is inspired by the Gossip and Contract Net protocols. Using GC we developed a GC-based DVMC strategy and compared it to two popular strategies: Sercon, a centralised strategy, and ecoCloud, a distributed strategy. One of the comparison experiments uses Google cluster-usage traces; a dataset of real usage data from a Google data centre. The GC-based strategy performs best with respect to SLA Violations, and is similar to or outperforms other strategies with respect to power consumption. By its decentralised nature, GC does not have a single point of failure.}

With emerging big data and cloud-based services, there are new opportunities for data collection, influencing both official data collection processes and the operation of the programmes they monitor. This paper uses cases and examples to explore the potential of crowdsourcing and public earth observation (EO) data products for monitoring and tracking the SDGs. This paper suggests that cloud-based services that integrate crowdsourcing and public EO data products provide cost-effective solutions for monitoring and tracking the SDGs, particularly for low-income countries. The paper also discusses the challenges of using cloud services and big data for SDG monitoring. Validation and quality control of public EO data is very important; otherwise, the user will be unable to assess the quality of the data or use it with confidence.}

Mobile Cloud Computing suffers from several security threats such as integrity and privacy issues. The integration of both areas results in better energy conservation and a more secure environment. Thus, this research introduces a secure energy-efficient platform that reduces the energy consumption and maintains privacy. The security approach of the platform utilizes a modified version of the Sharing-based Scheme and a Precision-enhanced and Encryption-mixed Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation scheme. The first supports both authentication and encryption using XOR gates, while the second is a slicing, secure data aggregation protocol that enhances both security and energy. For energy consumption reduction, asynchronous scheduling duty cycling based on Location, Priority and Pre-Configuration is introduced. The results show that the platform depends on the rate of sensing, frequency of sending data, data size, location and number of sleeping sensors, and smartphone battery capacity. In the case of less frequent rates and lower data sizes, the operational energy consumption is 1% of the mobile's entire battery capacity. In the case of sensors sleeping next to the sink, the cost is reduced by over 70% with an additional cost of 20% over the un-secured network. The simulations show that the encryption cost decreases as the number of sensors increases. Furthermore, when the number of sensors increase, the distance between the node decreases and therefore more sensors are tending to sleep, which leads to less energy consumption. As a result, the platform introduced in this work outperforms existing schemes for large numbers of sensors (greater than 300 sensors) with an additional average security cost of 2.96%.}

This paper proposes a method for automatically extracting building geometries from unorganized point clouds. The collected raw data undergo data downsizing, boundary detection, and building component categorization, resulting in the building components being recognized as individual objects and their visualization as polygons. The results of tests conducted on three collected as-is building data to validate the technical feasibility and evaluate the performance of the proposed method indicate that it can simplify and accelerate the as-is building model from the point cloud creation process.}

The objects of MS images do not have the same quality in all individual bands. Instead of a selection of individual bands, the complete information about input image obtained by limited bands with skew- and kurtosis-based ICA transforms, it is suitable for non-Gaussian application in the satellite image. In preprocessing, the spatial and spectral information is lost due to the low resolution of individual bands. The information is recovered from the high-resolution first principal component of the MS image. The classification was performed using k-means clustering, and accurate values were obtained with the proposed method. This method gives a good tradeoff between the spectral and spatial information and superior accuracy results compared with other enhancement and fusion methods.}
