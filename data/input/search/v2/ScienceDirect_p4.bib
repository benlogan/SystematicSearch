abstract = {The increasing heterogeneity and scalability of the Internet of everything, especially, the Energy Internet (EI), is a prompt for novel engineering paradigms. The current infrastructure of hardware technologies besides the available software stack is becoming obsolete for handling the advanced requirements of the smart energy ecosystem. Accordingly, software definitions of the Internet of Things (IoT) stack functions are gaining interest to provide more flexible and scalable implementations. This paper investigates a sophisticated softwarization explicit hybrid model predictive control strategy for energy storage facility systems through the accessor design pattern. This strategy is presumed to support and facilitate the integration of higher-level analytic and control functionalities within the IoT stack at edges and nodes. Simulation is conducted with the Ptolemy II software to evaluate the execution semantics of the proposed strategy. In addition, real-time experiments on a lab-scale hydraulic tank process with both abrupt and gradual commands test scenarios showed the efficiency and reliability of the accessor-based controllers for achieving the control objectives for the benchmark storage facility with an abstract implementation. The analysis shows that this process can serve as a benchmark to mimic the charge and discharge cycles of storage elements in EI ecosystems.}

However, due to conflicting multi-criteria and goals and factors, higher standards are required for green distribution transformer manufacturing. High standard manufacturing makes many manufacturers shoddy the internal components of green distribution transformers, resulting in disorderly competition in the market, which poses great challenges to the users' choice of transformers and the government's quality supervision. This paper proposes a cloud-based q-rung orthopair fuzzy multi-criteria framework for assessing the green distribution transformer manufacturing process from the perspective of conflicting relationships between criteria. It is applied to rank order four green transformer manufacturers in China based on the twelve mono-criteria under four categories of resource and energy utilization, production process and equipment, environmental coordination, green technology innovation, and their overall performance ranking results. Our analysis revealed that resource and energy utilization and green technology innovation is the motivating factors to improve the quality of green distribution transformer manufacturing and expert recognition, and the production process and equipment and environmental coordination are the inducing factors that reduce the quality of green distribution transformer manufacturing and the recognition of experts. These findings provide the demanders and government quality inspection departments with guidelines on the selection and evaluation of green distribution transformers, also identify the direction for the manufacturers to improve the technology and optimize the production of green distribution transformers.}

This paper studies the feasibility and efficiency of real-time software and hardware QCSP systems. Several highly efficient transmitter implementations are presented, demonstrating the relevance of the approach. The parallelization and optimization strategies are elaborated for both software and hardware receiver implementations. They allowed software implementations with throughputs above 50 kb/s (maximum for the LoRa standard), consuming as low as 27 μJ/b. Thanks to detailed algorithm refinements, the throughtput even exceeded 250 kb/s on FPGA using High-Level Synthesis methodology, for an estimated consumption of 3.9 μJ/b. The results support the viability of the QCSP approach for cloud-RAN and edge computing in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks.}

These changing patterns make it more challenging to accurately forecast solar radiation levels, which directly impact solar energy generation. This study, evaluates the solar energy potential using a real-time GSM-based communication system combined with an off-grid PV power plant in Tehran and Ahvaz, two regions in Iran with contrasting climates. To measure the output voltage, C++ language programming was used in Arduino_IDE programming language was utilized along with an Arduino Nano board, ATmega328P microcontroller, and sensors for measuring current, voltage, temperature, humidity, and time. The recorded data was sent through short message service. The results were compared with simulations from PVsyst, PVGIS, and the Global Solar Atlas. The findings revealed that the PV power production potential in Tehran, which is characterized by a cold and wet climate, was 4.101 kwh.kwp −1 with a capacity factor of 17.09%. In contrast, Ahvas, with its warm and dry climate, had a potential of 3.271 kwh.kwp −1 and a capacity factor of 13.63%. These values differed significantly from the estimates provided by PVsyst and the Global Solar Atlas. The Global Solar Atlas overestimated the PV potential by 15% and 18.2% in Tehran and Ahvaz, respectively, while PVsyst underestimated it by more than 15% in both locations. The real-time energy production was measured at 246.1 Wh and 196.27 Wh, compared to the estimated values of 283 Wh and 232 Wh from the Global Solar Atlas, 178.36 Wh and 142.63 Wh from PVsyst, and 221.4 Wh and 196.9 Wh from PVGIS in Tehran and Ahvaz, respectively. These results underscore the importance of accounting for recent climate changes when predicting near real-time solar generation, particularly in remote areas and regions that deviate from global trends.}

abstract = {China has implemented a number of national and regional water and energy policies to achieve its goals of carbon emissions (CE) reduction, energy saving, and water conservation. Given its high energy and water resources interdependence, a framework is needed that can provide both a unified and systematic assessment of these. This study investigates the effects of coupling China's energy tax and water fee policies using a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model. Several possible scenarios are simulated. The simulation results show that the water fee promotes water conservation, but its effect is limited at China's current water fee level. The energy tax is shown to be more effective in improving water-saving efficiency. Under the maximum energy tax scenario (EH), total energy and industrial water demand fall by 10.45% and 3.82%, respectively, compared with 0.59% and 0.72%, respectively, under the maximum water fee scenario (W8). Furthermore, the energy tax is more conducive to China's energy conservation and CE reduction (CER) targets than the water fee, but raising both energy taxes and water fees can have a significant impact on energy conservation and CER. In the scenario going from a low energy tax (EL) to a high-energy tax (EH), the reduction in primary energy production increases from 8.36% to 19.16%, while CE also drop significantly, going from 5.59% to 16.71%; however, In the scenario going from the low water fee (W2) to the high-water fee (W8), the reduction in primary energy production only changes from 0.24% to 0.43%, and CO2 reduction from 0.35% to 0.61%. Meanwhile, the mixed water-energy scenario shows a spill over effect, with the CE and energy savings management goals requiring less GDP loss than water or energy policies implemented in isolation. Ultimately, the results show that even when combined, relying solely on existing water and energy tax policies will be insufficient to meet China's water-saving targets without other environmental policies. The key to overcoming energy and water constraints is to increase water and energy efficiency year after year. This will enable China to achieve its CER target and the 14th Five-Year Plan water savings target. Thus, the synergistic effect of water conservation and energy saving can be realised simultaneously when the CER and energy consumption structure improve, which is crucial for developing an effective environmental policy strategy.}

While green data centers are a well-established objective, conventional approaches have focused on either high efficiencies and/or the use of renewable energy. This model extends and innovates both approaches with three key design aspects. First, it emphasizes the use of many small, geographically distributed mini data centers. Second, such data centers can operate with the option of being dislocated from the electrical grid via a mini-grid, or behind the meter. Third, the approach enhances the use of renewable energy via the ability to transfer computing load from one mini data center to another as renewable supply or market contexts dictate. This paper introduces the conceptual approach, outlines the research broadly, and examines potential technical, economic, and policy constraints for the establishment of this approach on a broad scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the developing world, particularly in areas without substantial electricity transmission infrastructure.}

In this paper, the evaluation criteria system of green cold chain logistics service providers is established from five dimensions: cold chain logistics service quality, cold chain logistics service cost, cold chain logistics service capability, cold chain logistics green competitiveness and cold chain logistics enterprise management status. Combined weighting method based on minimum information discrimination principle, including BWM method and CRITIC method to determine comprehensive weight, avoids the limitation of single weighting method to determine index weight. Aiming at the randomness and fuzziness in the evaluation process of green cold chain logistics providers, a cloud model evaluation method of cold chain logistics providers is proposed. The case study shows that the proposed combined weighting method overcomes the one-sidedness of the single weighting method and improves the rationality of the weights. The cloud model evaluation method of cold chain logistics suppliers proposed in this paper is helpful to deal with the randomness and fuzziness in the process of weight combination, and improve the effectiveness and scientific rationality of the weight combination results.}

abstract = {In low-voltage distribution networks, an uncontrolled charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) brings about intensive peak loads in distribution transformers’ daily load curves. Due to insulation degradations, this issue ends in transformers’ loss of life (LOL) and early aging. The notion of cloud energy storage system (CESS) with larger power and energy capacities enables consumers to have access to cheaper energy storage facilities. Thanks to CESS installation, semi-smart, controlled, and low-cost charging of PHEVs could be realized to relieve the transformer’s peak loads and reduce the peak-to-average (PAR) ratio of load curve. To do so, this paper develops an optimal planning model for siting and sizing of a CESS to accommodate the charge/discharge requirements of consumers who are willing to collaborate with CESS and hence, implementing a controlled charging of PHEVs. The proposed model considers the investment and operation costs of both CESS and distribution network. It also models the transformer LOL costs. The PHEVs, in private garages, are supposed to be connected to the grid through a smart module whose connection time and status is optimally scheduled and controlled through the operator of the CESS. The CESS charging/discharging is regulated such that the previously determined time targets of PHEV owners are satisfied. To assess performance of the proposed model, extensive numerical studies are carried out in terms of techno-economic indices say as PAR reduction, conducting energy arbitrage, power losses reduction, and etc. Results are discussed in depth.}

This study constructs a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model focusing on subsidies for cleaner production technology and environmental taxes for pollution among all current environmental fiscal and taxation policies. The objective of this paper is to evaluate and compare macroeconomic, environmental and industrial outcomes under twelve different scenarios to help the government choose the optimal policies. The results show that increasing the subsidy rate for cleaner production technology and increasing the environmental tax levy can both effectively reduce emissions but that increasing the environmental tax rate would have a negative impact on the macroeconomy and ionic rare earth production. If the subsidy rate and environmental tax levy are both raised to a certain level simultaneously, it would positively impact the macroeconomy, the environment and the production of ionic rare earths at the same time. Therefore, the Government of China should adjust the intensity of environmental fiscal and taxation policies for ionic rare earth mining and smelting and adopt a more appropriate policy combination to achieve optimal results at the comprehensive level.}

To solve the optimal dispatching problem of the IES coupled with electricity, heat, and gas, a cloud-edge-device architecture is constructed. A distributed group consensus algorithm (DGCA) is designed with two consistency protocols. The first protocol defines three groups of consistency variables, represented by the incremental cost of electricity, heat, and gas, respectively. The output estimation deviation of each component is used as a feedback. The second protocol considers the output estimation deviation of the three components as the consistency variables. The coupling variables of the two consistency protocols tend to be consistent, which can obtain the optimal output of each unit and achieve the optimal operation of the system. Furthermore, the proposed strategy accounts for transmission loss during transmission. Finally, through the hardware in the loop simulation based on the edge intelligent terminal (EIT), the effectiveness and feasibility of the strategy are verified, considering different cases.}

An effective method to reduce consumers' electricity bills is the usage of energy storage devices. However, the high investment and maintenance costs of these devices still limit their applications in the individual distributed framework. Recently, cloud energy storage (CES) as a shared energy storage technology has been introduced to provide storage services for residential consumers at a lower cost. In order to overcome the limitations of the individual framework and create new economic prospects, the CES is used in this paper to support numerous residential consumers in the energy market. This paper proposes an optimal energy management model in a transactive energy framework based on a distributed optimization mechanism for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading with the usage of the alternating direction method of multipliers. In this cooperative structure, residential users and CES participate in a decentralized framework to reach a consensus that preserves their privacy. In this proposed model, different types of loads, distributed energy resources and users' costs consisting of the grid energy cost, the P2P energy cost, the battery degradation cost, the thermal discomfort cost, the interruption cost, and the daily investment cost for individual batteries and CES are considered. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified through various simulations. Numerical results show that the presence of CES in the proposed model and its participation in P2P energy trading reduces the cost of residential users, decreases the energy demand from the network, and increases CES owner's profit. Therefore, the application of the proposed model is valuable for the residential users, CES, and the grid.}

This study has developed an Internet of Things (IoT) based SM that can reach high data rate of 38,400 bps or frequency of 160 MHz, using SQL Server for data storage and bidirectional data transmission with 174 W total load. In this way, consumers can track their energy consumption hourly, daily, and monthly, learn how much they spent on consumption, and receive warnings for a power outage.

The three dimensions of SIA are inherently intertwined and subject to trade-offs. Quantification of trade-offs for policy decision support requires numerical models in order to assess systematically the interference of complex interacting forces that affect economic performance, environmental quality, and social conditions. This paper investigates the use of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models for measuring the impacts of policy interference on policy-relevant economic, environmental, and social (institutional) indicators. We find that operational CGE models used for energy–economy–environment (E3) analyses have a good coverage of central economic indicators. Environmental indicators such as energy-related emissions with direct links to economic activities are widely covered, whereas indicators with complex natural science background such as water stress or biodiversity loss are hardly represented. Social indicators stand out for very weak coverage, mainly because they are vaguely defined or incommensurable. Our analysis identifies prospects for future modeling in the field of integrated assessment that link standard E3-CGE-models to themespecific complementary models with environmental and social focus.}

To assess the diagnostic performance of quantitative parameters from dual-energy CT (DECT) in differentiating parotid gland tumors (PGTs).
Materials and Methods
101 patients with 108 pathologically proved PGTs were enrolled and classified into four groups: pleomorphic adenomas (PAs), warthin tumors (WTs), other benign tumors (OBTs), and malignant tumors (MTs). Conventional CT attenuation and DECT quantitative parameters, including iodine concentration (IC), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), effective atomic number (Zeff), electron density (Rho), double energy index (DEI), and the slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve (λHU), were obtained and compared between benign tumors (BTs) and MTs, and further compared among the four subgroups. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent parameters and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the diagnostic performance.

Attenuation, Zeff, DEI, IC, NIC, and λHU in the arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP) were higher in MTs than in BTs (p < 0.001–0.047). λHU in VP and Zeff in AP were independent predictors with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 after the combination. Furthermore, attenuation, Zeff, DEI, IC, NIC, and λHU in the AP and VP of MTs were higher than those of PAs (p < 0.001–0.047). Zeff and NIC in AP and λHU in VP were independent predictors with an AUC of 0.93 after the combination. Attenuation and Rho in the precontrast phase; attenuation, Rho, Zeff, DEI, IC, NIC, and λHU in AP; and the Rho in the VP of PAs were lower than those of WTs (p < 0.001–0.03). Rho in the precontrast phase and attenuation in AP were independent predictors with an AUC of 0.89 after the combination. MTs demonstrated higher Zeff, DEI, IC, NIC, and λHU in VP and lower Rho in the precontrast phase compared with WTs (p < 0.001–0.04); but no independent predictors were found.

abstract = {Recently, energy efficiency in sensor enabled wireless network domain has witnessed significant attention from both academia and industries. It is an enabling technological advancement towards green computing in Internet of things (IoT) eventually supporting sensor generated big data processing for smart cities. Related literature on energy efficiency in sensor enabled wireless network environments focuses on one aspect either energy oriented path selection or energy oriented message scheduling. The definition of path also varies in literature without considering links towards energy efficiency. In this context, this paper proposes an energy oriented path selection and message scheduling framework for sensor enabled wireless network environments. The technical novelty focuses on effective cooperation between path selection and message scheduling considering links on path, location of message sender, and number of processor in sensor towards energy efficiency. Specifically, a path selection strategy is developed based on shortest path and less number of links on path (SPLL). The location of message sender, and number of processor in specific sensor are utilized for developing a longer hops (LH) message scheduling approach. A system model is presented based on M/M/1 queuing analysis to showcase the effective cooperation of SPLL and LH towards energy efficiency. Simulation oriented comparative performance evaluation attest the energy efficiency of the proposed framework as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques considering number of energy oriented metrics.}

Combined with it, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a comprehensive Digital Transformation tendency to solve the problems Cloud computing faces. However, the fundamental challenges of energy and latency make deploying IIoT MEC networks difficult. Accordingly, this paper considers the efficient design of time allocation for successful computation probability (SCP) maximization for multiple energy-constrained mobile devices (MD) and multiple antennas access point (AP) in uplink radio frequency energy harvesting (RF EH) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) IIoT network. Specifically, multiple MDs need to receive the energy and compute support of a MEC server placed in a multiple antenna wireless AP to complete the task immediately. Accordingly, a four-phase communication protocol is proposed to ensure system performance. The system follows the cluster head (CH) scheme based on the channel state information (CSI) to harvest RF energy from the AP. To ensure the highest system performance, we propose two algorithms for determining the optimal EH time for two CHs: SCPM-GSS and SCPM-GA. In addition, we derive the closed-form expressions for the SCP of the system and each CH. Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the results of the analysis. The numerical results demonstrate the effects of crucial system parameters of our proposed NOMA scheme with those of conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes. Furthermore, the proposed optimization algorithms allow the system to avoid outages like the random parameters setting approach and improve the SCP by 3 to 30% compared to the fixed parameters set when the transmit power is low and medium.}

Virtual machine placement has a significant impact on the energy efficiency of virtualized data centers. Among various methods to solve the virtual-machine placement problem, the genetic algorithm has been well accepted for its quality of solution. However, it is computationally demanding largely due to the complex form of fitness function, limiting its applications in data centers. To enhance the computational efficiency of the genetic algorithm while maintaining its quality of solution, a progressive-fidelity approach is developed in this paper for genetic-algorithm computation. It starts with a low-fidelity genetic algorithm with a simple fitness function. Then, for solution refinement, it switches to a medium-fidelity genetic algorithm with a more complicated fitness function. Finally, it progresses to the fine tuning of solution through a high-fidelity genetic algorithm with the energy consumption of data centers as fitness function. Heuristics are presented for the adaptive switching of genetic-algorithm computation from low fidelity to medium fidelity and finally to high fidelity. Experiments show that compared with the standard genetic algorithm of high fidelity, our progressive-fidelity approach of genetic algorithm computation is 50% faster for large-scale data centers while maintaining similar quality of solution in terms of the energy consumption of data centers.}

abstract = {This paper uses a multi-period economic-environmental Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling framework to analyse local sustainability policy issues. Our focus is the small, open, labour-constrained regional economy of Jersey. The case of Jersey is of particular interest for two main reasons. The first is the unusually low degree of geographical labour market integration for such a small regional economy. This motivates our treatment of labour as a region-specific factor of production. The second is the availability of high quality, Jersey-specific economic-enviromental data. We employ CGE model simulations to track the impact of changes in population on a number of energy-consumption and pollution indicators in a recursive dynamic framework under alternative hypotheses regarding economic conditions over the time period under consideration. In the case of Jersey, we find that household consumption is the key factor governing the environmental impact of economic disturbances. Therefore the analysis includes an examination of the sensitivity of the simulation results to different assumptions affecting the wage elasticities of labour demand and supply, and the speed of adjustment to equilibrium on the responsiveness of household income to shifts in labour supply.}

abstract = {A multi-trait selection index designed to improve the overall economic performance of hill sheep, including both maternal and lamb traits, has been developed and tested in a selection experiment over 7 years. Two versions of the index were tested, with different economic weights applied to the traits, on two different hill farms: one version including maternal and growth traits; the other version with additional breeding goals of carcass weight, fatness and conformation scores. Responses to selection, using both versions of the index, suggest that improvements are being made in overall index score and lamb growth. This study investigated the indirect effects of these selection indices on lamb carcass composition and muscularity traits, as measured using X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning. A total of 499 lambs from the two hill farms were CT scanned at weaning (approximately 120 days of age). Approximately half of the lambs from each farm were from the selection line (S, animals with highest index scores selected for breeding), while the other half were from a control line (C, animals with average index scores selected). Composition and muscularity traits were estimated on each lamb from CT data and differences between genetic lines investigated, within farm, using restricted maximum likelihood analyses, adjusting for either live weight or age. Results showed that the selection index without carcass traits produced lambs with carcass composition that was not significantly different to control lambs at a given live weight or age. Including carcass traits in the index resulted in lambs with no compositional differences (except for a slight increase in bone) at a set age compared with controls. At a given live weight however, selection lambs had less fat and lower carcass weights and killing-out percentage. Muscularity (3-D muscle shape) and muscle area shape (2-D) were not improved as a result of selection on either version of the index (including carcass weight and grades in the breeding goals or not) and, at a fixed live weight, muscularity in hind leg and lumbar regions tended to be higher in the C line. To accelerate changes in carcass composition and muscularity within the context of a multi-trait selection index for hill sheep, consideration should therefore be given to including objective CT-derived carcass traits in the index in addition to the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) carcass grades or ultrasound measurements.}

To identify open challenges in the area and facilitate future advancements, it is essential to synthesize and classify the research on power- and energy-efficient design conducted to date. In this study, we discuss causes and problems of high power/energy consumption, and present a taxonomy of energy-efficient design of computing systems covering the hardware, operating system, virtualization, and data center levels.

To solve this issue, we propose ELECT, an energy-efficient intelligent edge-cloud collaboration scheme that achieves satisfactory data processing performance. ELECT includes a platform that utilizes edge computing node as a core element that locates close to the IoT nodes for coordinating the data processing between the cloud and the IoT devices. Specifically, based on the importance of a node’s collected data in the overall data processing performance, a dynamic IoT node management algorithm is developed to manage each node’s active/inactive status to reduce energy consumption. Moreover, a deep Q-network (DQN)-based workflow scheduling algorithm that fully utilizes the data-centric device–edge–cloud continuum is introduced to reduce makespan and energy consumption for obtaining a compromising solution. For verification, we develop an experimental environment simulating structural health monitoring (SHM) services in remote areas. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ELECT in terms of various service requirements, including makespan, energy consumption and communication cost.}

However, despite the importance of this issue, so far, no bibliometric study has been done on this issue. Hence, this study aims to use methods drawn from nature to optimize power usage in software-defined networks. Additionally, a thorough and original categorization of energy-efficient solutions has been offered. During the bibliographic review, the sections of interest of researchers and some bibliographic information in the form of statistical information are expressed. Therefore, searching and selecting relevant keywords are done using the VOSviewer tool. The data is extracted from valid databases. Guidelines for future research on software-defined networks are derived based on the existing research projects' findings and the gaps and constraints that have been found. The results showed that the algorithms inspired by nature were successful in striking a balance among resource usage, energy consumption, and network performance.}

This paper exploits CES’s service modes to both energy storage and electricity trading for its users, e.g., microgrid (MG). The optimal day-ahead bidding strategy is investigated for CES as an independent entity in the electricity market. Besides, two energy service modes are introduced considering MG's requirements and preferences. Each mode consists of a set of schemes for energy storage system (ESS) rent (power-based and capacity-based) and electricity trading (internal price with an improved pricing method and market clearing price). Finally, a stochastic programming (SP)-based optimization model is formulated to maximize the CES’s expected profits fully considering the electricity market’s settlement mechanism and uncertainty as well as the participation interest of MG. The proposed solution is extensively assessed through a case study of CES’s energy services to five heterogeneous MGs with distinct electricity generation and consumption characteristics and two energy service modes are assessed through comparative experiments. The numerical results confirm the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed optimal day-ahead bidding solution.}

abstract = {Clustering has been adopted as a critical technique for reducing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Furthermore, the selected group of Cluster Heads (CHs) should enhance the network’s coverage while minimizing any impact on its energy efficiency. Although distributed CHs election processes have improved the network’s lifespan, they have struggled to provide adequate coverage. Moreover, they usually use impractical assumptions like unlimited transmission range and location cognition. On the other hand, centralized meta-heuristic-based CHs selection algorithms have shown remarkable improvement in clustering problems using centralized decisions. However, software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN) have gained a prevalent use in recent years. SDWSN consists of stripping control from nodes and centralizing it in an external controller. This paper introduces an energy-efficient and coverage-aware Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) based clustering process for SDWSN. Based on a novel fitness function, our proposed algorithm aims to maximize coverage, decrease blind spots, and preserve energy in the network. Our algorithm is widely evaluated on various homogeneous and heterogeneous network scenarios, with varied network sizes and base station (BS) locations, versus prominent clustering algorithms. The obtained results testify that our proposed algorithm shows better performance in energy efficiency and CHs distribution. Our algorithm improved coverage up to a mean of 31.42%, 27.72%, 18.69%, 21.12%, 13.81%, 4.14%, 3.8% and 8.31% compared to CREEP, DEEC, I-LEACH, HEESR, BRE-LEACH, PSO-ECHS, EPSO-CEO, and GWO-C, respectively, in all simulation cases.}

Most cases, patients wear multiple medical devices that transmit sensed medical data wirelessly to servers, which might cause big traffic on the communication networks, which in turn cause high energy consumption. Therefore, using the data aggregation, we can considerably reduce the energy consumption by eliminating redundant data; yet collected data must be fully protected. Secure data collection and transfer to centralized servers in healthcare applications employing IoT is quite challenging to protect against several attacks for illegal data access. For this reason, massive security measures should be taken to ensure that patients’ data can only be accessed by legitimate users. This paper proposes EPPADA: Efficient Privacy‑Preserving Authentication and Data Aggregation scheme in conjunction with Homomorphic Encryption concepts to meet requirements of healthcare using IoT with green computing technologies. The main objective of this proposed scheme is to decrease the communication overhead and energy consumption while maintaining safe and secure aggregation of the healthcare data between medical sensors and cloud servers. The proposed system is experimentally developed using E-health sensor shield V2.0 platform.

Bi2O3 has excellent gamma ray shielding properties, while Bi exhibits weak shielding performance of low-energy gamma rays in the range of 36.4–90.5 keV. In this work, a two-step hydrothermal strategy was proposed for Bi2O3-Gd2O(CO3)2∙H2O heterostructure (h-BG) to achieve effective shielding of the materials of low-energy gamma radiation. Bi2O3-Gd2O(CO3)2∙H2O/EP-30 composite has excellent shielding performance against low, medium, and high energy gamma radiation. In addition, the shielding performance of the Bi2O3-Gd2O(CO3)2∙H2O/EP-30 composites proved to be superior to some materials in the literature of 59.5 keV. Furthermore, simulations with the Phy-X/PSD program demonstrate that Gd2O(CO3)2∙H2O combined with Bi2O3 is an adequate method for achieving gamma radiation shielding in a wide energy region. The differential charge density calculations suggest that the formation of a heterogeneous interface between Bi2O3 and Gd2O(CO3)2∙H2O leads to an overlap of the interfacial electron cloud, which increases the probability of collision between the rays and the electrons. This is an essential reason for the enhanced gamma shielding property. This work could serve as a new strategy for the design of gamma radiation shielding materials.}

In our analysis we employ a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach, develop a modelling structure for private transport and provide detailed empirical analysis for the case of Austria. Regarding the social dimension, it has often been argued that poorer households (and commuters) would have to bear a disproportionate share of the road pricing burden. We find the contrary, i.e. a stronger negative policy impact on richer households, and on a small group of intensive car users. The choice of revenue recycling is able to ameliorate the negative social and economic effects of road pricing, without reversing the desired positive environmental effects. For political feasibility, questions of distributional impacts are most urgent and therefore we address them systematically within a quantitative framework.}

abstract = {Dynamic data structures in software applications have been shown to have a large impact on system performance. In this paper, we explore energy saving opportunities of interface-based dynamic data structures. Our results suggest that savings opportunities exist in the C5 Collection between 16.95% and 97.50%. We propose a prototype and architecture for creating adaptive green data structures by applying machine learning tools to build a model for predicting energy efficient data structures based on the dynamic workload. Our neural network model can classify energy efficient data structures based on features such as the number of elements, frequency of operations, interface and set/bag semantics. The 10-fold cross validation result show 95.80% average accuracy of these predictions. Our n-gram model can accurately predict the most energy efficient data structure sequence in 19 simulated and real-world programs—on average, with more than 50% accuracy and up to 98% using a bigram predictor. Our GreenC5 prototype demonstrates how a green data structure can be implemented. With a simple decision making technique, the data structure can efficiently adapt for energy efficiency with low overhead. The actual medians of GreenC5′s potential energy savings from two test computers are 61.19% and 60.56% and range from 18% to 95%.}

abstract = {Context
The energy efficiency of IT systems, also referred to as Green IT, is attracting more and more attention. While several researchers have focused on the energy efficiency of hardware and embedded systems, the role of application software in IT energy consumption still needs investigation.
Objective
This paper aims to define a methodology for measuring software energy efficiency and to understand the consequences of abstraction layers and application development environments for the energy efficiency of software applications.
Method
We first develop a measure of energy efficiency that is appropriate for software applications. We then examine how the use of application development environments relates to this measure of energy efficiency for a sample of 63 open source software applications.
Results
Our findings indicate that a greater use of application development environments – specifically, frameworks and external libraries – is more detrimental in terms of energy efficiency for larger applications than for smaller applications. We also find that different functional application types have distinctly different levels of energy efficiency, with text and image editing and gaming applications being the most energy inefficient due to their intense use of the processor.
Conclusion
We conclude that different designs can have a significant impact on the energy efficiency of software applications. We have related the use of software application development environments to software energy efficiency suggesting that there may be a trade-off between development efficiency and energy efficiency. We propose new research to further investigate this topic.}

Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact. In this paper, we define an architectural framework and principles for energy-efficient Cloud computing. Based on this architecture, we present our vision, open research challenges, and resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. The proposed energy-aware allocation heuristics provision data center resources to client applications in a way that improves energy efficiency of the data center, while delivering the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, in this paper we conduct a survey of research in energy-efficient computing and propose: (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering QoS expectations and power usage characteristics of the devices; and (c) a number of open research challenges, addressing which can bring substantial benefits to both resource providers and consumers. We have validated our approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant cost savings and demonstrates high potential for the improvement of energy efficiency under dynamic workload scenarios.}

In addition to energy, carbon emission tax imposes another cost on data centers, which have different policies in different cities around the world. Most of the cloud data centers are geographically distributed, which can have a huge advantage in reducing such costs. In addition, in recent years, cloud federation, in which multiple cloud providers share their IT infrastructures voluntarily, could play a crucial role in minimizing the energy consumption of cloud data centers. On the other hand, improper VM placement results frequent VM migration, constant turning off/on physical machines, service quality degradation and energy consumption increase. To tackle these weaknesses, we propose a multi-objective algorithm, Called OUR-ACS, to minimize data centers' energy consumption, carbon emission, and the total expenses (energy cost + carbon tax) in a federated environment considering both initial VM placement and VM consolidation approaches. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm by using the ClousSim Plus simulator toolkit using real-world datasets. Compared to the competing algorithms, our simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm could reduce the total energy consumption, carbon emission, and the total costs of multiple cloud data centers by an average of 37.6%, 41%, and 25%, respectively, in a federated environment.}

Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources – around 70 percent of all freshwater withdrawals are used for food production. These agricultural products are traded internationally. A full understanding of water use is, therefore, impossible without understanding the international market for food and related products, such as textiles. Based on the global general equilibrium model GTAP-W, we offer a method for investigating the role of green (rain) and blue (irrigation) water resources in agriculture and within the context of international trade. We use future projections of allowable water withdrawals for surface water and groundwater to define two alternative water management scenarios. The first scenario explores a deterioration of current trends and policies in the water sector (water crisis scenario). The second scenario assumes an improvement in policies and trends in the water sector and eliminates groundwater overdraft world-wide, increasing water allocation for the environment (sustainable water use scenario). In both scenarios, welfare gains or losses are not only associated with changes in agricultural water consumption. Under the water crisis scenario, welfare not only rises for regions where water consumption increases (China, South East Asia and the USA). Welfare gains are considerable for Japan and South Korea, Southeast Asia and Western Europe as well. These regions benefit from higher levels of irrigated production and lower food prices. Alternatively, under the sustainable water use scenario, welfare losses not only affect regions where overdrafting is occurring. Welfare decreases in other regions as well. These results indicate that, for water use, there is a clear trade-off between economic welfare and environmental sustainability.}

Our proposed algorithm considers multiple geo-distributed cloud data centers and acknowledges both IT and non-IT power usage during the virtual machine placement process. An extensive simulation in the CloudSim Plus framework is conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm using real-world datasets, including workloads, power model benchmarks, and outside temperature. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce energy consumption by 17% and carbon emissions by 6% on average compared to other competitor algorithms.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) is an emerging technology in radiotherapy (RT). Here, we investigate split-filter DECT throughout the RT treatment chain as compared to single-energy CT (SECT).
Materials and methods
DECT scans were acquired with a tin-gold split-filter at 140 kV resulting in a low- and high-energy CT reconstruction (recon). Ten cancer patients (four head-and-neck (HN)​, three rectum​, two anal/pelvisand one abdomen) were DECT scanned without and with iodine administered. A cylindrical and an anthropomorphic HN phantom were scanned with DECT and 120 kV SECT. The DECT images generated were: 120 kV SECT-equivalent (CTmix), virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs), iodine map, virtual non-contrast (VNC), effective atomic number (Zeff), and relative electron density (ρe,w). The clinical utility of these recons was investigated for calibration, delineation, dose calculation and image-guided RT (IGRT).
Results
A calibration curve for 75 keV VMI had a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 34 HU in closest agreement with the RSME of SECT calibration. This correlated with a phantom-based dosimetric agreement to SECT of γ1%1mm > 98%. A 40 keV VMI recon was most promising to improve tumor delineation accuracy with an average evaluation score of 1.6 corresponding to “partial improvement”. The dosimetric impact of iodine was in general < 2%. For this setup, VNC vs. non-contrast CTmix based dose calculations are considered equivalent. SECT- and DECT-based IGRT was in agreement within the setup uncertainty.
Conclusions
DECT-based RT could be a feasible alternative to SECT providing additional recons to support the different steps of the RT workflow.}

To build the geothermal combined single-effect evaporator system, we compared the outcomes of manual computations performed in Excel and MATLAB/Simulink.

Calculations performed manually, Excel or MTALB/Simulink, should all have the same value, with only a little variation. In this case, latent and sensible heat for seawater evaporation is supplied by low enthalpy geothermal heat employed as heating steam with a temperature of less than 130 °C. We focus on a wide range of characteristics to better understand the impact of design choices on evaluation findings. Some variables include heating steam temperature, boiling temperature, feed water salinity, and geothermal resource quality.

The lack of an accurate and computationally efficient model to describe the thermal condition of the data center environment makes it challenging to develop an effective and adaptive VMP mechanism. Although recently, data-driven approaches have acted successfully in model construction, the shortage of clean, adequate, and sufficient amounts of data put limits their generalizability. Moreover, any change in the data center configuration during operation, makes these models prone to error and forces them to repeat the learning process. Thus, researchers turn to applying model-free paradigms such as reinforcement learning. Due to the vast action-state space of real-world applications, scalability is one of the significant challenges in this area. In addition, the delayed feedback of environmental variables such as temperature give rise to exploration costs. In this paper, we present a decentralized implementation of reinforcement learning along with a novel state-action representation to perform the VMP in the data centers to optimize energy consumption and keep the host temperature as low as possible while satisfying Service Level Agreements (SLA). Our experimental results show more than 17% improvement in energy consumption and 12% in CPU temperature reduction compared to baseline algorithms. We also succeeded in accelerating optimal policy convergence after the occurrence of a configuration change.}

So, the high energy consumption, inefficient resource usage, and quality of service assurance (QoS) are major challenges for cloud data centers. The dynamic consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) is proven to be an efficient way to tackle these issues while reducing energy consumption and improving resource utilization in data centers. It reduces the number of active hosts for energy efficiency by switching under-utilized and idle hosts into lower power mode. So, several heuristics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based VM consolidation approaches have been published in papers. Most existing approaches rely on the aggressive consolidation of VMs for energy efficiency, thus causing performance degradation and high SLA violation. However, an automated solution is needed to reduce energy consumption and SLA violation by ensuring efficient resource usage in the cloud data center environment. Therefore, this article proposes an energy-efficient autonomous VM consolidation (AVMC) mechanism that has Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based agent for performing VM consolidation decisions. The DRL agent learns the optimal distribution of VMs in the data center, considering energy efficiency and QoS assurance. The real-time workload traces from PlanetLab have been used to validate the proposed mechanism. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed AVMC system over the existing models. AVMC reduced the energy consumption and SLA violation rate significantly.}

To that end, this paper encompasses the concept of green renewable energy in the fog environment.

This proposed scheme is also formally verified for the safety properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the scheme performs significantly better than the compared approach in terms of energy consumption in the power saver mode.

Using a 1-year old pediatric phantom, five contrast agent concentration diluent tubes of 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of the same concentration as the average Hounsfield unit (HU) in the descending aorta were inserted, and the mixed image and VMIs (40, 60, and 80 keV) acquired using dual-energy CT were compared with single-energy CT (SECT) images. For quantitative evaluation, the HU and coefficient of variation (COV) of each image were compared and analyzed. The analysis revealed that the HU of the 40 keV VMIs, acquired with a tube voltage of 70 kV and 100% contrast agent concentration, was 61% higher than that of the SECT image. The results showed that SECT had the lowest COV among all contrast agent concentration and tube voltage combinations, while the 40 keV image acquired at 70 kV had the second-lowest COV value. The HU of the 40 keV image acquired at 70 kV at a contrast agent concentration of 100% was 9% higher than that of SECT at 80% concentration. This study confirms that 40 keV VMIs are more useful than SECT images for vascular diagnosis with contrast in pediatric abdominal CT examinations and that a 20% reduction in contrast agent concentration can reduce the risk of contrast agent concentration-induced nephrotoxicity in pediatric patients by increasing the subjective acceptability of image quality for diagnosis.}

abstract = {Cloud energy storage systems (CES) are a new paradigm for the application of consumer-side energy storage in residential community microgrids. By transforming traditional consumers into self-sustaining and utility consumers, CES facilitates interaction between consumers and utilities as well as between consumers. Residential CES development is complicated by the flexible capacity of CES batteries and the uncertainty of supply. This paper recommends the CES system for residential prosumers. A machine learning-based uncertainty quantization and an artificial ecosystem optimization (AEO) method are used to determine optimal battery capacity considering PV, load, and price uncertainty. Compare this algorithm to the other four optimization algorithms to find out how well it works. The feasibility and profitability of deploying CES with residential PV are assessed. This problem minimizes the user’s cost and maximizes the profit of the CES operator. The sensitivity analysis of CES is analyzed for various storage capacity penetrations. Further, optimal battery capacity determines the use of an AEO algorithm. Based on a PJM dataset of residential PV, load, and electricity price, simulation results demonstrate that the suggested framework integrated with a distributed PV system is more economical to DES.}

The inefficient utilization of resources makes high energy consumption and low quality of service (QoS) in resource management an urgent problem to be solved. We propose a load balancing strategy based on virtual machine consolidation (LBVMC), which aims to reduce the energy consumption and service level agreement (SLA) violation of data centers by balancing the multi-dimensional resource utilization in physical machines (PMs). First, we present a load state classification algorithm for PMs with load abnormality considering current and future loads to reduce unnecessary virtual machine (VM) migrations caused by occasional load fluctuations. Then, we propose a resource-weight based selection model for migratable VMs, which selects appropriate VMs to be migrated based on multi-dimensional resource utilization, and reduces resource fragmentation caused by load imbalance. Finally, we design a VM placement algorithm based on resource fitness and load correlation to deploy VMs on the optimal destination PMs to assure load balancing of the destination PMs after VM placement. We perform simulated experiments under homogeneous, heterogeneous, and bottleneck resource environments. Experimental results show that LBVMC is superior to other strategies in reducing energy consumption and SLA violations and achieves better overall performance.}

This is a challenging task for which modelling and software have become key instruments used to promote sustainability and improve environmental decision processes. This role can especially be one that facilitates systematic integration of various knowledge and data, that fosters learning and helps to make predictions. This book presents the current state of the art in environmental modelling and software and identifies the future challenges in the field. This opening chapter provides an introduction to the topic, the objectives of the book and an outline of its chapters. Modelling can perform a range of valuable roles, from being a process of sharing and structuring knowledge to providing a means of investigating tradeoffs or increasing system understanding. Without full appreciation of their limitations and capabilities, however, there is a risk of models being misused or their outputs misinterpreted. On the other hand, model uncertainty cannot be totally eliminated but it can be understood, communicated and managed. The common problems in modelling that must be understood by modellers and users, and approaches to address them are discussed in the first few chapters. This section of chapters highlights the need for better standards in modelling practice, appropriate handling of uncertainty and improvement of model usability. The next section of the book explores generic and sectoral issues in modelling in the context of the state of the art in modelling tools and approaches, and thereby identifies future research, development and practice needs. Challenges pervasive in various modelling fields include the need for more credible and purposeful models, for better uncertainty management and for more support of an open and collaborative modelling process. Overall a much stronger emphasis on the modelling and software process is warranted.}

At the same time, inter-operation amongst Grids is on track. To be the core of Grid systems, the resource management must be autonomic and inter-operational to be sustainable for future Grid computing. For this purpose, we introduce HOURS, a reputation-driven economic framework for Grid resource management. HOURS is designed to tackle the difficulty of automatic rescheduling, self-protection, incentives, heterogeneous resource sharing, reservation, and SLA in Grid computing. In this paper, we focus on designing a reputation-based resource scheduler, and use emulation to test its performance with real job traces and node failure traces. To describe the HOURS framework completely, a preliminary multiple-currency-based economic model is also introduced in this paper, with which future extension and improvement can be easily integrated into the framework. The results demonstrate that our scheduler can reduce the job failure rate significantly, and the average number of job resubmissions, which is the most important metric in this paper that affects the system performance and resource utilization from the perspective of users, can be reduced from 3.82 to 0.70 compared to simple sequence resource selection.}

We aim to maximize the average EE of the mobile edge computing network by the joint design of user transmit power, user computing frequency, UAV transmit power, bandwidth allocation, and UAV trajectory planning under strict energy and power constraints. In order to solve such challenging problem, we first elaborately construct a Markov decision process to model task offloading and resource allocation by learning from past experiences. Then, an average EE maximization method relying on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is designed to efficiently adjust task offloading policy, where the policy of agent can be gradually improved by interacting with the environment and collecting the experience for learning. Finally, the EE-maximization proximal policy optimization (EE-PPO) algorithm is proposed to train the DRL agent and thereby solve this optimization problem. Numerical results are given to indicate that the proposed EE-PPO method has the properties of both fast convergence and well performance.}

abstract = {With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, green supplier selection as an indispensable part of green supply chain management has received extensive attention. Effective and reliable green supplier evaluation criteria are crucial to the success of green supplier selection. Therefore, identifying the critical criteria and determining the causality of these criteria is an important requirement of stakeholders. However, the existing approaches on identifying critical causal criteria suffer at least two weaknesses: firstly it assumes the same cognitive levels between different decision makers by using a pre-determined and uniformed formation to characterize evaluation judgements, which may cause potential decision bias; secondly there is a lack of effective methods to analyse and identify critical causal criteria in the face of heterogeneous judgements, potentially causing the duplication consideration of the impacts of some criteria in green supplier selection. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach integrating cloud model and DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) to determine critical causal criteria for green supplier evaluation with qualitative heterogeneous judgements. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, to address the difficulty in processing uncertain and heterogeneous judgements, the cloud model theory is utilized and further developed to convert heterogeneous qualitative judgements into homogeneous quantitative data with the form of interval integrated clouds, which realizes the flow of uncertainty from qualitative judgements to quantitative data. Second, to enable the identification of critical causal criteria, the DEMATEL method is extended to accommodate the cloud model environment to solve the identification problem. Third, a case study, followed by a comparison analysis is provided to illustrate the applicability and advantages of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can handle heterogeneous judgements effectively as well as that staff environmental training, green production innovation, green marketing and green corporate culture are the critical causal criteria for the given application.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
In proton therapy, a 3.5% margin is often used to account for proton range uncertainties, of which computed tomography (CT) image noise is assumed to contribute 0.5%. This work evaluates the noise-sensitivity of three dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)-based methods for mapping proton stopping power relative to water (SPR): Näsmark & Andersson (N&A), Landry-Saito (L-S), and the commercial application DirectSPR.
Methods and materials
DECT image data of a CIRS-062M phantom was acquired with CT scanners from two different vendors. Acquisitions were repeated 30 times to account for intra- and inter-scan variations. SPR maps were generated with the three DECT-based methods and range simulated in a commercial treatment planning system.
Results
Noise in input data was amplified in L-S SPR maps, kept level with DirectSPR, while N&A compressed noise overall but displayed sensitivity to the choice of input data, potentially leading to increased noise levels. In our simulations, only N&A improved upon the assumed 0.5% noise contribution to range uncertainty on one scanner. On the other scanner, uncertainties exceeded 0.5% for all three methods. Mitigation of this issue was demonstrated by using a method employing virtual mono-energetic images as input. Increasing imaging radiation dose, as expected, alleviates the problem, while applying noise reduction only helped to a lesser extent.
Conclusions
While range uncertainty due to noise is small compared to other contributions, it becomes more important as we move towards smaller treatment margins and the noise-sensitivity of SPR mapping methods should be carefully estimated and considered before clinical implementation.}

To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) with and without dedicated software in identifying uric acid kidney stones in vivo.
Material and methods
We studied 65 kidney stones in 63 patients. All stones were analyzed in vivo by DECT and ex vivo by spectrophotometry. We evaluated the diagnostic performance in identifying uric acid stones with DECT by analyzing the radiologic densities with dedicated software and without using it (through manual measurements) as well as by analyzing the attenuation ratios of the stones in both energies with and without the dedicated software.
Results
The six uric acid stones included were correctly identified by evaluating the attenuation ratios with a cutoff of 1.21, both with the dedicated software and without it, yielding perfect diagnostic performance without false positives or false negatives. The study of the attenuations of the stones obtained the following values on the receiver operating characteristic curves in the classification of the uric acid stones: 0.92 for the measurements done with the software and 0.89 for the manual measurements; a cutoff of 538HU yielded 84% (42/50) diagnostic accuracy for the software and 83.1% (54/65) for the manual measurements.
Conclusions
DECT enabled the uric acid stones to be identified correctly through the calculation of the ratio of the attenuations in the two energies. The results obtained with the dedicated software were similar to those obtained manually.

The SDN controller uses probe messages to periodically update the Remote Radio Head (RRH) for synchronizing channel access and power-saving of mobile nodes among different cells. The required node address and flow-rules are transferred to an RRH as per the location of a mobile node. We adopt a Markov Chain-based approach to predict the collision in the uplink channel and location of a mobile node. RRH determines the different sleeping schedules for itself and other low-power IoT devices, as per the current demands collected from the controller and stations. We show a use case of 6G-SDI, where the SDN controller predicts CO2 emissions of a vehicular network and send a set of critical alerts caring information such as CO2 level and the number of vehicles. The proposed scheme helps in taking adequate actions for sending commands or alerts with improved network energy consumption, latency, and throughput. 6G-SDI reduces critical traffic latency and energy consumption up to 55% and 62%, respectively, compared to the existing state-of-the-art.}

abstract = {The ever-increasing computation tasks and communication traffic have imposed a heavy burden on cloud data centers and also resulted in a significantly high energy consumption. To ease such burden, edge computing is proposed to explore the distributed resources of edge devices (e.g., base stations) to provision the cloud services for latency-sensitive applications at the network edge. Owing to the geo-distribution of edge devices, edge computing is also an ideal energy efficient platform to leverage the distributed green energy for energy efficient computing. Thus, it is natural to integrate Energy Internet (EI) technology into edge computing for customizable energy scheduling. In such EI supported edge computing, both the green energy generation rates and the data processing demands vary in different time and space. To pursue high energy efficiency, it is desirable to maximize the utilization of green energy so as to reduce the brown energy consumption. This requires careful task allocation and energy scheduling to match the energy provision and demand. In this paper, we investigate the energy cost minimization problem with joint consideration of VM migration, task allocation and green energy scheduling and prove its NP-hardness. To tackle the computation complexity, a heuristic algorithm approximating the optimal solution is proposed. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce brown energy consumption and perform much close to the optimal solution.}

abstract = {At present, there always is a significant gap between the design and the actual operation performance. This study presents the application of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy synthetic evaluation method based on cloud model theory to evaluate the overall operation performance of the green public buildings, considering indoor environment quality (IEQ) and energy consumption. The evaluation method contains three criteria as objective IEQ, subjective IEQ and annual energy consumption. Criteria of objective and subjective IEQ includes the same six sub-criteria of thermal environment in summer, in winter and in transition season, luminous environment, air quality and acoustic environment. The criteria annual energy consumption includes four sub-criteria of air conditioning electricity, lighting and socket electricity, power electricity and special electricity. Two cases of green and non-green library building are applied to be evaluated by this method, which is also validated with other method. Building managers can judge if the building performs efficiently or not with the evaluation method, and can also find which criteria or sub-criteria has poor operation performance. Furthermore, the evaluation method can reflect the relationship between sub-item of energy consumption and corresponding sub-criteria of IEQ, it can provide a direction for optimizing energy consumption. This evaluation method can not only be applied to evaluate the operation performance of different similar buildings, but also can be applied to evaluate the same building in different years. This study can provide a certain guiding significance for the development of evaluation the comprehensive operation performance of green buildings.}

abstract = {In recent years, the Green Internet of Things (G-IoT) has gained a lot of attention to developing energy-efficient communication systems. It consists of electronic devices and is integrated with numerous tight constraint sensors for observing the real world and provide communication services to end-users. However, optimal data collection and its management among the heterogeneous G-IoT objects are one of the main challenges. Many researchers are still proposing different solutions to cope with such problems and offering IoT-cloud paradigms for processing, storage, and scalability services. However, the data of smart cities is forwarded using the open-source IoT platform, and sensitive information may be compromised. Therefore, this research aims to propose a model of security measures using the Green Internet of Things with Cloud Integrated Data Management (M-SMDM) for Smart Cities. Firstly, it forms a long-run and energy-efficient connectivity using self-balancing trees and distributing load factors uniformly in green communication systems. Secondly, it addresses the problem of secret key distribution between peer nodes and attained trust for both partial and direct communication. In the end, it securing the transmission system from mobile gateways to application users against threats with improved overheads and data latency. The security analysis of the proposed M-SMDM model is done along with simulation-based experiments. The attained results disclose the importance of the proposed model in terms of network parameters compared to existing work.}

In this paper, an energy-efficient 10T SRAM-based IMC macro architecture is proposed to perform logic, arithmetic, and In-memory Dot Product (IMDP) operations. The average write margin and read margins of the proposed 10T SRAM are improved by 40% and 2.5%, respectively, compared to the 9T SRAM. The write energy and leakage power of the proposed 10T SRAM are reduced by 89% and 83.8%, respectively, with aproximatelly similar read energy compared to 9T SRAM. Additionally, a 4 Kb SRAM array based on 10T SRAM is implemented in 180-nm SCL technology to analyze the operation and performance of the proposed IMC macro architecture. The proposed IMC architecture achieves an energy efficiency of 5.3 TOPS/W for 1-bit logic, 4.1 TOPS/W for 1-bit addition, and 3.1 TOPS/W for IMDP operations at 1.8 V and 60 MHz. The area efficiency of 65.2% is achieved for a 136 × 32 array of proposed IMC macro architecture. Further, the proposed IMC macro is also tested for accelerating the IMDP operation of neural networks by importing linearity variation analysis in Tensorflow for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. According to Monte-Carlo simulations, the IMDP operation has a standard deviation of 0.07 percent in accumulation, equating to a classification accuracy of 97.02% on the MNIST dataset and 88.39% on the CIFAR dataset.}

NUTS-BSNN is a fully binarized spiking neural network with all binary weights, including the input and output layers. In the input and output layers, the weights are represented as stochastic series of numbers, while in the hidden layers, they are approximated to binary values for using simple XNOR-based computations. To compensate for the information loss due to binarization, we increased the convolutions at the input layer sequentially computed over multiple time-steps. The results from these operations are accumulated before generating spikes for the subsequent layers to increase the overall performance. We chose 14 time-steps for accumulation to achieve a good tradeoff between performance and inference latency. The proposed technique was evaluated using three datasets by direct training method and using a surrogate gradient algorithm. We achieved classification accuracies of 93.25%, 88.71%, and 70.31% on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively.

In this paper, we take a step further and, in contrast to existing approaches, exploit DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) on the CPU, together with an intelligent CPU-FPGA resource provisioning mechanism, to further improve energy. For that, we propose EASER, an end user-transparent framework that employs multiple strategies and dynamically selects the most appropriate one to optimize resource provisioning and DVFS according to the warehouse needs, workload properties, and target architecture. Our synergistic DVFS optimization brings up to 22% additional energy gains over our dynamic provisioning alone. Compared to fixed single strategies with DVFS, EASER brings, on average, 71% of energy gains.}

This phenomenon is controlled by physical/chemical interactions, which can be accurately described by first-principles calculations. Several computational tools have been developed to study molecular adsorption based on high throughput/automatized approaches in recent years. However, these tools can sometimes be over-sophisticated for non-expert users. Here we present Xsorb, a Python-based program for identifying the accurate adsorption energy and geometry of complex molecules on crystalline (reconstructed) surfaces. The program automatically samples the potential energy surface (PES) that describes the molecule-surface interaction by generating several adsorption configurations through symmetry operations. The set of the most representative ones is automatically identified through a fast pre-optimization scheme. Finally, the PES global minimum is identified through a full structural optimization process. We show the program capabilities through an example consisting of a hydrocarbon molecule, 1-hexene, adsorbed over the (110) surface of iron and the reconstructed (001) surface of diamond. This program, despite its conceptual simplicity, is very effective in reducing the computational workload usually associated with the creation and optimization of several adsorption configurations.

The energy consumption of cloud data centers is dramatically increasing, which has created a lot of problems with greenhouse gas emissions and service costs. Server consolidation is a popular approach to reduce cloud data centers’ energy consumption by minimizing the number of active physical machines. Most of the extant research has focused on server reduction in the consolidation process, but unbalanced resource utilization among different physical machines can cause the waste of physical resources. This paper proposes a resource-utilization-aware energy efficient server consolidation algorithm (RUAEE) that can be used to improve resource utilization while reducing the number of virtual machine live migrations. Experimental results show that RUAEE can reduce the energy consumption and service-level agreement (SLA) violation in cloud data center.}

In this atomistic study, we report structure-property correlations of Si (001) small angle mixed grain boundaries (SAMGBs) across three macroscopic GB characters (tilt character, twist character, and an implicit rotation character between them). Firstly, for the computed SAMGB energies spanning the three-dimensional GB character space, a revised Read-Shockley relationship is proposed and fitted, which hints that the energy trends follow the Read-Shockley formalism from the insight of GB decomposition. GB structural transitions from dislocation to amorphous structures are also given as a function of dislocation core radii, allowing the estimation of small angle GB proportion. Then, the proportion, topology and structural signatures of different SAMGB types defined from the ratio between the tilt and twist angles are presented. By extracting the transformation of metastable SAMGB phases, the formation process of these (001) SAMGB structures is characterized as the energetically favorable dislocation glide and reaction, from which the dislocation density function is derived. The relevant results about SAMGB energies and structures are validated and supported by theoretical calculations and experimental observations, respectively.}

Energy consumption management is the first class concern for cloud providers in this energy hungry devices and also for the green computing goals. In the large DCs, the power management of hundreds or even many thousands idle switches can be a promising approach toward overall cost reduction. The virtual machine placement (VMP) scheme which is aware of both VMs affinity and underlying network topology for co-hosting dependent VMs as physically near as possible and lowering down power state of idle devices can enhance sustainability objectives. On the other hand, resource wastage lowers system utilization which leads more physical server usage causing more power consumption as a consequence. To address the issue, this paper presents an energy-efficient topology-aware VM placement scheme in the cloud DCs which is formulated to a multi-objective optimization problem with power consumption and resource wastage minimization perspective. To deal with this combinatorial problem, an advanced multi-objective discrete version of JAYA (MOD-JAYA) algorithm is presented since the search space of VMP is discrete in nature. The proposed algorithm is validated by intensively variable circumstances and simulations upon conducted scenarios. The simulation results prove the superiority of the proposed advanced MOD-JAYA algorithm in solving VMP problem in comparison with other existing schemes in terms of prominent assessment metrics.}

A major challenge is the systematic bias in TCDC simulations induced by the errors in the numerical model parameterization stages. Correction of GFS-derived cloud forecasts at multiple time steps can improve energy forecasts in electricity grids to bring better grid stability or certainty in the supply of solar energy. We propose a new kernel ridge regression (KRR) model to reduce bias in TCDC simulations for medium-term prediction at the inter-daily, e.g., 2–8 day-ahead predicted TCDC values. The proposed KRR model is evaluated against multivariate recursive nesting bias correction (MRNBC), a conventional approach and eight machine learning (ML) methods. In terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), the proposed KRR model outperforms MRNBC and ML models at 2–8 day ahead forecasts, with MAE ≈ 20–27%. A notable reduction in the simulated cloud cover mean bias error of 20–50% is achieved against the MRNBC and reference accuracy values generated using proxy-observed and non-corrected GFS-predicted TCDC in the model’s testing phase. The study ascertains that the proposed KRR model can be explored further to operationalize its capabilities, reduce uncertainties in weather simulation models, and its possible consideration for practical use in improving solar monitoring and forecasting systems that utilize cloud cover simulations from numerical weather predictions.}

BDLSTM takes into account the data’s past and future context. The future hidden layer takes input in ascending order while the past hidden layer evaluates the input in decreasing order, making BDLSTM relevant in analyzing the input data’s past context and evaluating future predictions. The eleven-year (2010–2020) weather dataset used for this paper was acquired from NASA. Two pre-processing approaches, Automatic Time Series Decomposition (ATSD) and Pearson correlation, were used to remove the noisy values from the residual components and for feature selection, respectively. To ensure storage and reuse of data, the architecture includes a cloud-based server for data management and reuse for future predictions. Popular in multi-energy systems, the cloud-based server also serves as a platform for monitoring predicted solar energy data.

In hybrid cloud, privacy-sensitive tasks are not allowed to be executed on public resources, while non-sensitive tasks are unrestricted. As an NP-Complete problem, it is extraordinarily challenging to schedule multiple workflows efficiently, economically and energy-savingly under quality-of-service constraints. This paper models the hybrid-cloud-based privacy-aware multi-workflow scheduling as a tri-objective optimization problem that optimizes workflow-oriented total tardiness, private-cloud-oriented total energy consumption, and public-cloud-oriented total monetary cost. To the best of authors’ knowledge, few studies have been conducted on the tri-objective privacy-aware multi-workflow scheduling in hybrid cloud (PMWS-HC). To solve this problem, we dissect various factors involved during task scheduling and devise a novel Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm based on 9 Factors (HSA9Fs), which dynamically selects the workflows and tasks to be scheduled, and the corresponding VMs to execute them. To optimize the three conflicting objectives simultaneously, we propose a nested algorithm called MSIA, which first employs a Multi-objective Salp swarm algorithm to explore for the Pareto solutions, and then uses an Iterative greedy Algorithm to perform a refined search on individuals to obtain high-quality solutions. Extensive Medium-Small-Scale and Large-Scale simulation experiments show that both HSA9Fs and MSIA outperform state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms in several multi-objective performance metrics.}

abstract = {Background
Objective and subjective assessment of image quality of brain metastases on dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) and its impact on target volume delineation.
Materials and Methods
26 patients with 37 brain metastases receiving Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and DECT for stereotactic radiotherapy planning were included in this retrospective analysis. Lesion contrast (LC), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed for reconstructed VMI at 63 keV and artificial 120 kV Computed Tomography (CT). Image contrast and demarcation of metastases between 120 kV CT, VMI and MRI were subjectively assessed. Brain metastases were delineated by four radiation oncologists on VMI with a fixed or free brain window and contours were compared to solely MRI-based delineation using the Dice similarity coefficient.
Results
LC, CNR and SNR were significantly higher in VMI than in 120 kV CT (p < 0.0001). Image contrast and lesion demarcation were significantly better on VMI compared to 120 kV CT (p < 0.0001). Mean gross tumor volume (GTV)/planning target volume (PTV) Dice similarity coefficients were 0.87/0.9 for metastases without imaging uncertainties (no artifacts, calcification or impaired visibility with MRI) but worse for metastases with imaging uncertainties (0.71/0.74). Target volumes delineated on VMI were around 5–10% smaller compared to MRI.
Conclusion
Image quality of VMI is objectively and subjectively superior to conventional CT. VMI provides significant advantages in stereotactic radiotherapy planning with improved visibility of brain metastases and geometrically distortion-free representation of brain metastases. Beside a plausibility check of MRI-based target volume delineation, VMI might improve reliability and accuracy in target volume definition particularly in cases with imaging uncertainties with MRI.}

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have undergone rapid development but still suffer from energy shortage issues. Meanwhile, existing energy-efficient routing approaches lack a cross-layer cooperation mechanism and cannot offer intelligent decision-making capabilities for resource-constrained nodes. In this paper, we design an intelligent routing algorithm with adaptive duty cycling for application in software-defined WSNs (SDWSNs) to maximize the network lifetime and data transmission reliability subject to a long-term data queue stability constraint. In particular, we introduce Lyapunov optimization to decouple the multistage routing optimization problem into per-frame deterministic problems with delay guarantee. To optimize the routing algorithm and adaptively adjust the duty-cycling mechanism, we propose a cooperative deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) model. Moreover, we develop a centralized training and distributed execution framework to decouple the model training and inference processes, which provides the capability of intelligent routing decision-making for resource-constrained nodes with low computational complexity. In addition, we design a new hybrid routing metric and a unique feature construction and extraction scheme to capture fine-grained information from our hybrid routing metric. The proposed CDRL algorithm adopts a cooperative and iterative model optimization strategy to achieve highly reliable data transmission and optimal long-term network performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and statistical delay performance under various scenarios compared to the EBR-RL, EA-AGG, and QLRP algorithms.}

Thermal control is a key issue in hyper-scale cloud data centers. Hotspots form when the temperature of the host rises, increasing cooling costs and affecting dependability. Precise estimation of host temperatures is critical for optimal resource management. Thermal changes in the data center make estimating temperature a difficult challenge. Existing temperature estimating algorithms are ineffective due to their processing complexity as well as lack of accuracy. Regarding that data-driven approaches seem promising for temperature prediction, this research offers a unique efficient temperature prediction model. The model uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacking multi-layer bi-directional long-term short memory (BiLSTM) for thermal prediction. The findings of the experiments reveal that the model successfully anticipates the temperature with the highest R2 value of 97.15% and the lowest error rate of RMSE value of 0.2892, and an RMAE of 0.5003, which decreases the projection error as opposed to the other method.}

Each job is associated with a start-time, an end-time, a process time, and demand for machine capacity. The goal is to schedule all of the jobs nonpreemptively in their start-time–end-time windows, subject to machine capacity constraints such that the total busy time of the machines is minimized. We refer to this problem as minimizing the total busy time for the scheduling of multiple identical machines (MinTBT). This problem has important applications in power-aware scheduling for Cloud computing, optical network design, customer service systems, and other related areas. Scheduling to minimize busy time is already NP-hard in the special case in which all jobs have the same process time and can be scheduled in a fixed time interval. One best-known result for this problem is a 5-approximation algorithm for special instances using the first-fit-decreasing (FFD) algorithm. In this chapter, we propose and prove a 3-approximation algorithm, modified first-fit-decreasing-earliest for the general case and obtain more results for special cases. We then show how our results are applied in Cloud computing to improve energy efficiency.}

abstract = {Efficient integration of solar energy into the electricity mix depends on a reliable anticipation of its intermittency. A promising approach to forecasting the temporal variability of solar irradiance resulting from the cloud cover dynamics is based on the analysis of sequences of ground-taken sky images or satellite observations. Despite encouraging results, a recurrent limitation of existing deep learning approaches lies in the ubiquitous tendency of reacting to past observations rather than actively anticipating future events. This leads to a frequent temporal lag and limited ability to predict sudden events. To address this challenge, we introduce ECLIPSE, a spatio-temporal neural network architecture that models cloud motion from sky images to not only predict future irradiance levels and associated uncertainties, but also segmented images, which provide richer information on the local irradiance map. We show that ECLIPSE anticipates critical events and reduces temporal delay while generating visually realistic futures. The model characteristics and properties are investigated with an ablation study and a comparative study on the benefits and different ways to integrate auxiliary data into the modelling. The model predictions are also interpreted through an analysis of the principal spatio-temporal components learned during network training.}

The mapping between several algorithms and different models of partitioning on Central and Graphic Processing Units (CPU–GPU) has been conducted. The complexity and performance of the Operator Splitting Quadratic Program (OSQP) or Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for a centralized or decentralized resolution according to the hardware have been studied and analyzed in different test cases.

Such services should also be energy efficient for sustainable cities. Though energy efficiency has been widely studied over the past decade, yet most such solutions have focused on device or sensor level solutions or alternatively on cloud/datacenter level solutions. With the prominence of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) in recent times owing to its flexible and scalable network management features, SDN based fog level resource management has become an attractive alternative. This paper addresses fog level energy-aware resource management with the goal of minimizing energy consumption while QoS fulfillment by means of Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation through live migrations. Since any decent sized smart city would have millions of devices and large numbers of edge/fog instances, it would lead any solution mechanism to a NP hard problem.

In order to optimise direct effects, tools are required which provide methods for energy modelling and to analyse and optimize the energy consumption of a given program. Indirect effects are harder to assess, since their optimization requires changing economical incentives. However, it is important to optimise both kinds of effect in order to provide sustainable software, since the amount of energy consumed during the operation of a device is in the same order of magnitude as the energy used during its production.

abstract = {As the penetration rate of renewable energy increases in the electric power system, the issues of renewable power curtailment and system inertia shortage become more severe. Innovative solutions such as Cloud Energy Storage (CES) can be employed to address this challenge. However, the energy storage resources aggregated by the traditional CES business model mainly concentrate on Electrical Energy Storage (EES), which is still limited and expensive. It necessitates the exploration of new approaches to enhance the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of energy storage utilization, in which using District Heating System (DHS) as an equivalent energy storage resource of the power system is an effective method. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal planning strategy of energy storage system under the CES model considering inertia support and electricity-heat coordination. Firstly, the system components and business model of the CES are described, and the framework of energy storage planning problem from the perspective of CES operator is formulated. Then the evaluation methods of energy storage utilization demand from CES users are proposed, including the evaluation of the renewable power curtailment, system minimum inertia requirement, and the equivalent energy storage ability of DHS. Based on this evaluation results, a bi-layer optimal energy storage planning model for the CES operator is established, where the upper-layer model determines the installed capacity of lithium (Li-ion) battery station and the lower-layer model determines the optimal schedules of the CES system. The numerical tests based on the operation profile of a typical city in China are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation result shows that the annual profit of the CES system can be improved by 15.26% after installing the energy storage system whose capacity is determined by the proposed method.}

The objective function is presented as minimizing the total net present cost (NPC), load loss, and battery degradation cost. The decision variables include the number of PVs, WTs, batteries, inverter power, and the angle of PVs installation, which is optimally determined via a new meta-heuristic optimization algorithm named opposition-based learning and Gradient-based optimizer (OBLGBO). In the proposed framework, the cloud theory method based on combining fuzzy theory and probability statistics has been applied for modeling the energy resources and load demand uncertainties. The simulation results indicate that considering battery degradation costs increases the overall cost of designing hybrid systems. As the cost of degradation increases, reliability indices improve due to an increase in the number of wind turbines and a decrease in the number of batteries. Also, the results demonstrated that incorporating the uncertainties based on the cloud theory increases the design cost, and the system reliability is weakened. Therefore, the proposed optimal framework has presented a real and accurate approach to the optimal design of energy systems with more accurate knowledge of electricity generation costs and the cost of improving reliability in conditions of uncertainties. Moreover, the superior capability of the OBLGBO compared with traditional GBO and the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is proved to achieve lower design cost and better reliability indices.}

In terms of completion time, the obtained schedules are also shorter than those of other algorithms. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the potential of DVS.}

To fill this knowledge gap, we employ a newly developed recursive computable general equilibrium model to explore the socioeconomic consequences of various recycling schemes in the context of China. We find that: (1) Although carbon pricing promotes renewable energy, it adversely affects social welfare and urban–rural equality. When executing the recycling scheme, this negative effect is alleviated. (2) All single recycling scenarios fail to yield a double dividend. They remain detrimental to social welfare and urban–rural equality. (3) Despite small welfare loss, a moderate-share renewables-based mixed recycling scheme reduces urban–rural inequality while favoring decarbonization and energy transition. Our study calls for incorporating mixed recycling options into the policy toolbox in advancing carbon pricing.}
