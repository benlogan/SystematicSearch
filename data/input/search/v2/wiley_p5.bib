abstract = {Summary This chapter identifies three scenarios that current energy-aware cloud solutions cannot handle as isolated IaaS, but their federative efforts offer opportunities to be explored. These scenarios include multidata-center cloud operator, commercial cloud federations and academic cloud federations. Based on these scenarios, energy-aware scheduling policies to be applied in the management solutions of cloud federations are identified. The authors applied these approaches in an federated cloud management (FCM) architecture, which provides a unified interface over multiple cloud providers. A new scheduling policy that minimizes the overall energy consumption of a federation while maintaining its performance, is also discussed. New heuristics for energy-aware virtual machine (VM) management are also discussed. The chapter investigates how service integrations among different providers can be performed with the application of these strategies, in order to enable enhanced reliability, scalability, and utilization to broaden the market for smaller providers.}

abstract = {Summary This chapter considers the integration of fog computing and energy harvesting (EH) according to which tasks can either be executed locally or offloaded to a fog server. It examines both EH from ambient sources and wireless power transfer. The chapter presents a review of resource allocation problems, emphasizing their categorization, comparison, e.g. in terms of a common objective, and the identified challenges. It investigates some future research challenges. The chapter also examines fog computing system with EH mobile users (MUs). Fog systems with EH MUs call for redesigned offloading policies, which become more complex than the ones of mobile cloud computing systems. The chapter also presents two characteristic examples i.e. the tradeoff between the energy consumption and the latency and the one between the execution delay and the task dropping cost.}

abstract = {Abstract With the rapid rise of connected vehicles on the road, there is an exponential growth in vehicle-related data (vehicle-data) generated and accumulated by connected vehicles. Taking advantage of cloud computing, enabling a vehicle-data sharing system can make various services based on vehicle-data available. However, the untrusted nature of the cloud server raises a challenge on how to balance privacy and functionality over the vehicle-data outsourced to the vehicle-data sharing system. Identity-based encryption with equality test (IBEET) is a viable solution to this challenge as it not only ensures data privacy but also enables searchable functionality over the encrypted data while dealing with the certificate management issue that exists in public key encryption with equality test (PKEET). However, the existing IBEET schemes are unable to be applicable into the vehicle-data sharing in cloud computing due to the fact that they did not consider the consequences of unexpected exposure of trapdoors given to cloud server and different levels of computing capabilities of the system entities. Therefore, this article introduces the notion of secure-channel-free IBEET (SCF-IBEET) scheme and presents a generic construction of the SCF-IBEET scheme by addressing the above-mentioned issues simultaneously. The proposed SCF-IBEET construction achieves one-wayness under chosen-identity and chosen-ciphertext attacks, indistinguishability under chosen-identity and chosen-ciphertext attacks, and trapdoor anonymity securities with respect to five different types of adversaries. Furthermore, the security comparison and efficiency analysis indicate that the proposed construction is reasonable with regard to security and viable in terms of efficiency to be applied to practical scenarios as vehicle-data sharing in cloud computing.},

Especially, the application of biocomposites-based memristor for simulating artificial synapses called bio-memristor has further facilitated the progress of ecologically benign bioelectronics. In this study, the authors present that the environment-friendly nanocomposites films, consisting of Ag nanoparticles and cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)-based bio-memristor with excellent bipolar resistive switching behavior can perform the artificial bio-synaptic emulation with continuous resistance modulation for memory storage and neuromorphic computing applications. The bio-memristor exhibits a large resistive switching (ION/OFF as high as ≈104 and ultralow SET/RESET voltage of ≈0.2 V) and reliable switching characteristics through the electrochemical formation/rupture of Ag metallic filaments within the nanocomposite layer. The device presents coexistence of digital and analog switching properties favorable for both nonvolatile digital memory and neuromorphic computing applications. By applying appropriate pulse stimulations to the device, the authors demonstrate biological synaptic functions, including long-term potentiation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, excitatory post-synaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation, and paired-pulse depression. Thus, this CNC-based bio-memristor as an effective artificial synaptic device is beneficial towards the realization of green-electronics and bio-inspired neuromorphic systems.},

abstract = {The prevailing divergent, empirical biomedical R\&D heavily rely on statistics for variation, probability, correlation, and significance that may lead to inefficiency or high cost-effectiveness. An alternative precision/quantitative approach with Nature's biochemical, biophysical and bio-mathematical principle, leads to the unified fundamental Doctrine of the Median (DoM), that serves as the as the largest common denominator to simplify biomedical complexity and diversity. Instead of using many data points to fit the empirical curves or models, we can reversely, using only few dose data-points to fit DoM, with MAL equations, algorithms and auto-computer simulations of diagnostic plots using CompuSyn software, to achieve quantitative, automated, digitalized or indexed conclusions, in vitro, in animals and in clinical trials. Thus, experimental observations-first priority has become MAL theory-first compliance endeavor. From MAL to DoM to MAL-BD/PD/BI, took over 17 years to complete that involve the derivation of over 300 bio-reaction rate equations via the un-precedent pattern analysis, combinatory analysis and mathematical induction-and-deduction. MAL-BD/PD/BI reveals three main paradigms: (1) The Median-effect equation (MEE) as the unified theory that indicates i. Dose and Effect are interchangeable, ii. Median dose (Dm) is the universal reference point and dynamic-order common link, iii. Ki can never greater than IC50, iv. Dose-effect curves (DEC) can be linearized into straight lines, with slope (m) and x-intercept (log Dm) of the Median-effect plot (MEP), and v. The DEC can be generated via MEP with a minimum of only two data points (the MTDP theory) by computer simulation, where the 3rd point is dose-zero, and the 4th point is the universal Dm point. Thus, for data-points availability, 2 becomes 4, 3 becomes 5, and 4 becomes 6. This is a breakthrough for in vivo study/trials. (2) The Combination Index equation (CIE) where CI<1, =1, and >1 indicates, synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively. (3) The Dose reduction index equation (DRIE), where DRI>1, =1, and <1, indicate favorable, no dose-reduction, and unfavorable dose-reduction, respectively, in drug combinations. The diagnostic plots provide needed BI. The terms of DoM, MEE and CIE are all dimensionless ratios, these indicating that the theory is independent to drug's physical entities (chemicals, biologicals, natural products, radiation, temperature, oxygen-tension, and pH, etc), units (ug, nM, mg/ml, mg/kg, IU, Rad, multiple of infections, etc) or mechanisms of actions (competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, sequential, ordered, ping-pong, and random mechanisms). As of Jan 1, 2021, the article introduced MAL-BD/PD/BI algorithms (Chou TC, Pharmacol. Rev. 58:621-681, 2006) received 3,813 citations in 1,030 biomedical journals. In addition, the article introducing the CI algorithm and computer software (Chou TC and Talalay P. Adv. Enz. Regul. 22:27-55, 1984) received 6,937 citations in 1,338 biomedical journals globally. These confirmed the board applications to nearly all disciplines of biomedical R\&D.},

Providing open access to this technical review would complement the scientific review of the contribution, efficiently reduce the workload of the undisclosed reviewers, improve the algorithm implementation quality and software sustainability, and ensure full reproducibility of the reported results. Using this process creates incentives to publish scientific algorithms in open source software – instead of designing prototype algorithms with the unique purpose of publishing a paper. In addition, the comments and suggestions of the community being archived in the versioning control systems ensure that also community reviewers are receiving credit for the review contributions – unlike reviewers in the traditional peer review process.

Edge computing as a promising computing pattern deployed close to service users is expected to improve the quality of service (QoS). To fully utilize the capabilities of edge devices, a Device-to-Device (D2D)–based computing resource sharing and aggregation framework is proposed. Under this framework, this paper exploits the Beta distributions to characterize the uncertain communication rate and processing capability of the edge environment. The reliability and energy consumption of local computing and shared computing under uncertain conditions are, respectively, studied. We model the task scheduling as an Integer Programming problem, whose objective is to minimize the energy consumption while ensuring the reliability. Based on that, a heuristic task scheduling algorithm named EASE is proposed. Through a lot of simulation experiments, the performance of EASE is effectively evaluated under the static and dynamic environments. Compared with three comparison algorithms, EASE shows many advantages in terms of reliability, adaptability, and energy saving.},

abstract = {Summary Nowadays, image and video processing applications have become widely used in many domains related to computer vision. Indeed, they can come from cameras, smartphones, social networks, or from medical devices. Generally, these images and videos are used for illustrating people or objects (cars, trains, planes, etc) in many situations such as airports, train stations, public areas, sport events, and hospitals. Thus, image and video processing algorithms have got increasing importance, they are required from various computer vision applications such as motion tracking, real time event detection, database (images and videos) indexation, and medical computer-aided diagnosis methods. The main inconvenient of image and video processing applications is the high intensity of computation and the complex configuration and installation of the related materials and libraries. In this paper, we propose a new framework that allows users to select in a smart and efficient way the computing units (CPU or/and GPU) in a cloud-based platform, in case of processing one image (or one video in real time) or many images (or videos). This framework enables to affect the local or remote computing units for calculation after analyzing the type of media and the algorithm complexity. The framework disposes of a set of selected CPU and GPU-based computer vision methods, such as image denoising, histogram computation, features descriptors (SIFT, SURF), points of interest extraction, edges detection, silhouette extraction, and sparse and dense optical flow estimation. These primitive functions are exploited in various applications such as medical image segmentation, videos indexation, real time motion analysis, and left ventricle segmentation and tracking from 2D echocardiography. Experimental results showed a global speedup ranging from 5× to 273×(compared to CPU versions) as result of the application of our framework for the above-mentioned methods. In addition to these performances, the parallel and heterogeneous implementations offered lower power consumption as result of the fast treatment.},

abstract = {Summary The problems of energy shortage engage us to find new resource, and varieties of renewable energy produced in different places are looking forward to be feedback to the power grids. These requirements also make power grids start to change from centralized structure with a few power plant to distributed system with many generating stations. To fit the building requirement of Smart Grid, smart units and their information networks with functions of measurement protection and control are becoming necessities. This paper tries to give a new small grid with curtains applications. Around this grid needs, paper introduces the development of Smart Units, the real-time networks and information web services: (i) The Smart Unit is multi-μPU instruments with function of measurement analysis and control, which includes intelligent algorithms of FFT Zoom-FFT Wavelet to fit signal processing, networks communication protocols with Ethernet and 3G/4G interfaces, and controlling functions to control devices like Intelligent Broker and Intelligent Capacitor; (ii) Based on Ethernet, a real-time controlling protocol named Synchronous Ticket Strategy (STS) is proposed, which is used to manage to synchronize measurement and control; and (iii) Information web services are built on cloud computing platforms, which provide parallel calculation with S transmit and user application services like power parameters GIS and data accessing. At the end some results are given from simulations of algorithms and online tests. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Power consumption is one of the main challenges to achieve Exascale performance. Current research trends aim at overcoming power consumption constraints using low-power processors. Although new processors feature sensors that enable precise power measurements, they provide different interfaces to collect data, making it difficult to correlate performance with energy consumption. To overcome this issue, the authors developed a platform-independent tool that collects power and energy data from homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Using this tool, they provide a detailed comparison between a low-power processor (ARM big.LITTLE) and a high performance processor (Intel Sandy Bridge-EP) using all applications from the NAS parallel benchmarks and a real-world soil irrigation simulator. The results show that the average power demand of Intel Sandy Bridge-EP is within 12.6× to 152.4× higher than ARM big.LITTLE, whereas its average energy consumption is within 1.6× to 7.1× superior. Overall, ARM big.LITTLE presented a better performance/energy trade-off when it takes <9.2× the execution time of Intel Sandy Bridge-EP to solve the same problem.},

abstract = {Summary This chapter reviews quantum algorithms for exact molecular energy calculations, that is, quantum analogs of the full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations. First, the chapter provides the necessary basics of quantum computing including the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), the phase estimation algorithm (PEA), and their semiclassical variants. Next, it presents details of the quantum algorithm for the FCI method (qFCI). It discusses the application to molecular Born–Oppenheimer electronic Hamiltonians. The chapter briefly mentions the initial state preparation and deals with the crucial part of the algorithm, namely the implementation of controlled powers of the exponential of molecular Hamiltonians. It further demonstrates an application of the qFCI method to non-relativistic ground and excited state energy calculations on the example of the methylene molecule. Finally, the chapter talks about the qFCI method for four-component (4c) relativistic computations.}
