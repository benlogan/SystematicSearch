abstract = {Currently, there are limited techniques for non-experts to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and software tools developed by industry and academia for assessing each aspect of product sustainability performance. Moreover, the variety of available methods and software tools makes it challenging for non-experts to identify the most appropriate analysis option. This research aims to assist non-experts in selecting the most appropriate set of analysis methods and software tools prior to conducting sustainable engineering analysis (SEA) based on life cycle data accessible to them. A questionnaire-based ranking methodology is developed for non-experts, which reduces their time investment in examining the myriad SEA methods and tools and avoids non-value added effort. The questionnaire uses an interaction matrix within a general mathematical modeling approach to map a given set of methods and tools to user responses. Relevance weights are integrated within the matrix to rank available environmental, economic, and social assessment methods and tools for user consideration. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, a pilot project was conducted to improve the design of a hexacopter. Results were compared using lower- and higher-fidelity software tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the relevance weights assigned to each tool. Assigned weights were determined to enable differentiation between low and high fidelity methods and tools, but as new methods and tools enter into use, these weights must be updated. The process of selecting SEA methods and software gives insight into the utility of the interaction matrix implemented within the tool developed in this research. Moreover, non-experts can compare various design alternatives using the selected analysis methods and software tools to arrive at a solution with improved sustainability performance.}

abstract = {Context:
Decision making pervades software and systems engineering. Intertemporal decisions involve trade-offs among outcomes at different points in time. They play a central role in systems design, as recognised since the inception of the software engineering (SE) field. They are also crucial for the sustainability of design decisions. However, temporal decision making is not adequately understood in SE. The field of Judgement and Decision Making (JDM) offers important empirical findings and research methods that could be utilised.
Objective:
This article establishes a baseline for studying how software professionals handle intertemporal choices. It examines how temporal distance affects choices in an example scenario, explores in what areas of software development such decisions can be found, and examines how systems design decisions can be characterised and studied as intertemporal.
Method:
We developed a method to study intertemporal choice in SE, based on an initial set of psychological theory grounded in JDM. We instantiated the method in a study to elicit responses to an intertemporal choice task followed by a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) interview.
Results:
We found that study participants overall tended to discount future outcomes, but individual participants varied wildly in how they valued present vs. future outcomes. They indicated several locations in which intertemporal choices occur in everyday software development. Based on these findings, and by reconciling our initial theory with existing JDM theory and results, we further developed and refined our theory and study method into a framework for studying intertemporal decision making in SE.
Conclusions:
To obtain a basis for more sustainable software systems design decisions, SE research should adopt a more comprehensive, detailed, and empirically consistent way of understanding and studying intertemporal choices. We provide suggestions for how future research could achieve practical methods that address essential characteristics of real-life systems design decisions.}

abstract = {This paper presents a Microsoft Excel tool to calculate liquid-gas mass transfer coefficients in packed towers to support numerical design activities in the courses of Unit Operations for Industrial Process and Sustainable Process Design for the Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering of the University of Naples Federico II (Italy). The Mass Transfer Solver Tool (MT Solver Tool) uses several available models to estimate, separately, the values of liquid and gas mass-transfer coefficients and the wet surface area for 144 random and structured packings of interest for absorption/stripping and distillation processes. In addition, a separate spreadsheet can be used in a user-defined mode, to evaluate the mass transfer coefficients with new packing types or to interpret experimental data when the geometrical and physical characteristics of the packing are known. Eventually, the tool is supplied with a data library, where packing geometry and model fitting parameters can be retrieved. The software is aimed to support students and educators in the Unit Operations for Industrial Process and Sustainable Process Design courses. In particular, this is meant to be an example on how the accuracy of design algorithms adopted in unit operation processes is affected by the use of the underpinning correlations for mass transfer rate or pressure drops. Besides, this is aimed to encourage comparison of different correlations when exact field data are not available. Besides, chemical engineers and researchers interested in packed columns design and modelling data may also benefit from the utilization of the software. The MT Solver Tool was introduced to students in a dedicated tutorial lesson after lecturers on packed column design algorithms for distillation, absorption and stripping. Most of the students of the course participated to a group training aimed to simulate the design of an absorption column supported by the MT Solver Tool providing feedback on its application. After the training, an anonymous survey was proposed to the students to monitor the approval rating of the proposed activity and the use of the MT Solver Tool software to support numerical calculations.}

In this work, in study class consisting in students of the Logistic and Transport Engineering program, it is developed and implemented a realistic problem situation: a sales e-commerce company has to decide, by analyzing received orders, whether to implement its own delivery system or hire a third-party delivery company. The software GeOrder Simulator is employed to generate random data for weight and location of simulated orders and the data are presented to students in tabular and iconic, onto a map geolocation, semiotic representation registers. The research aim of this work, is to analyze, from the perspective of Semiotic Representation Theory, the effect onto the statistical reasoning that is provoked in students when they solve the realistic problem situation with the data generated by the GeOrder Simulator. The results show that the addressing of the realistic problem situation together with the usage of the GeOrder Simulator, elicited the statistical reasoning in the students since it is observed the integration of statistical concepts within their argumentation, by means of the coordination of tabular, graphical and numerical semiotic representation registers.}

Although many policies in China have been issued to promote construction waste management, unfortunately there is no significant effect, and the key is lack of a quantitative evaluation system and guidance on management level. Based on the domestic and foreign relevant experiences, this paper puts forward a new system to evaluate waste management performance in an architectural engineering project. Through research, main influence factors of construction waste management in our country are confirmed, namely: “commitment of contractor's representative on site; collecting packed materials back by suppliers; minimizing rework in the construction phase; design and construction using standardized materials; and appointment of laborers solely for waste disposal”. Through four construction cases in the Pearl River Delta with the application of performance assessment model of waste management in architectural engineering projects, it is proved that the model can effectively measure the waste management performance in construction site, with clearer responsibilities and higher performance. Finally, it is suggested that our government should assess waste management performance in construction site pertinently, develop market assessment software actively, and promote the environmental sustainable development of architectural industry.}

It has boosted the integration of sustainable, sound practices across different fields (e.g. e-participation, smart transportation, sustainable agriculture). Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have strongly supported social transitions in becoming more sustainable and participative over the last two decades. Integrating multi-disciplinary sustainability concepts into the higher education of computer scientists is important in that this ensures that future ICT endeavours will take sustainability concerns into account. This article describes four capstone projects developed by students from the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Pervasive Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM), who were enrolled alongside regular students in a traditional software engineering course held at the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The coursework was part of a research project called Green.Citizen@ICT, which aims at investigating the use of ICT and software services for infusing sustainable habits in citizens through the development of applications for SD. This study demonstrates how a sustainable development focus can be integrated into a traditional software engineering course. The goal of this article is to enhance understanding of the integration of sustainability into software engineering education, by providing a detailed example of a master course in which this took place. This course supported the development of ICT competences for building cleaner, greener, and more resource- and energy-efficient cyber-physical systems, while addressing the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.}

This simulation help to better comprehend the interplay between mechanical and electrical stimulations during these processes. This study aimed to optimise the modelling of piezoelectric effects in bone modelling analysis. The connection between mechanical loads applied to bones and the resulting electrical charges generated by the piezoelectric effect was examined. Furthermore, mathematical modelling and simulation techniques were employed to enhance the piezoelectric effect and promote bone tissue growth and repair. The findings from this research have substantial implications for developing novel therapies for bone-related diseases and injuries. It was observed that electrically stimulated bone surfaces increased bone deposition. In some instances of physical disability or osteoporosis, therapeutic electrical stimulation can supplement the mechanical stresses of regular exercise to prevent bone loss. Consequently, the bone remodelling method on the software platform enables easy application and repetition of finite element analysis.

abstract = {Context
The main part of software engineering methods, tools and technologies has developed around projects as the central organisational form of software development. A project organisation depends on clear bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time. What happens when these conditions are not given? The article claims that this is the case for software product specific ecosystems. As software is increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of customisable and configurable products, software engineering as a discipline needs to take on the challenge to support software ecosystems.
Objective
The article provides a holistic understanding of the observed and reported practices as a starting point to device specific support for the development in software ecosystems.
Method
A qualitative interview study was designed based on previous long-term ethnographical inspired research.
Results
The analysis results in a set of common features of product development and evolution despite differences in size, kind of software and business models. Design is distributed and needs to be coordinated across heterogeneous design constituencies that, together with the software, build a product specific socio-technical ecosystem. The technical design has to support the deference of part of the development not only to 3rd-party developers but also to local designers tailoring the software in the use organisation. The technical interfaces that separate the work of different design constituencies are contested and need to be maintained permanently. Development takes place as cycles within cycles – overlaying development cycles with different rhythms to accommodate different evolution drivers.
Conclusion
The reported practices challenge some of the very core assumptions of traditional software engineering, but makes perfect sense, considering that the frame of reference for product development is not a project but continuous innovation across the respective ecosystem. The article provides a number of concrete points for further research.}

In light of the ecological crises and the tremendous impact of digital systems on reshaping economic and social arrangements - often with negative side-effects - we need a sustainability transformation of the digital transformation. However, this is a complex and long-term task. In this article we combine an analysis of accountability arrangements in software engineering and a model of sustainability transformations to trace how certain dynamics are starting to make software engineering accountable for sustainability in the technological, cultural, economic and governance domains. The article discusses existing approaches for sustainable software engineering and software engineering for sustainability, traces emerging discourses that connect digitalization and sustainability, highlights new digital business models that may support sustainability and shows governance efforts to highlight “green and digital” policy problems. Yet, we argue that these are so far niche dynamics and that a sustainability transformation requires a collective and long-lasting effort to engender systemic changes. The goal should be to create varied accountability arrangements for sustainability in software engineering which is embedded in complex ways in society and economy.}

While some studies have reviewed the development in these two domains separately, they did not address the important associations between them, nor did they analyze their joint advancement over time. Therefore, this study aims to understand and quantitatively analyze the dynamic evolution of relationships between BIM and sustainability critical towards developing BIM's functionalities to satisfy the industry's growing sustainability needs. First, 523 relevant journal articles published over the last 15 years were collected. Rule-based content analysis is then conducted on these articles using text mining to retrieve and structure relevant textual data pertaining to the six defined dimensions: BIM functionalities, software, sustainability aspects, green certification systems, project phases, and stakeholders. Social network theory is then applied to map and measure the associations between the dimensions' components for analyzing the dynamic changes in their synergies over three spans. Results reveal a significant transformation in the diversity, magnitude, and expansion of associations between BIM and sustainability domains across the supply chain. Findings also highlight less explored areas that require further research and industrial attention towards achieving full use of BIM and sustainability's integrated power. This work's novelty lies in comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing these often-dismissed synergies to reveal through knowledge-based findings how BIM has progressed to address the industry's changing sustainability requirements and recommend future directions for advancing sustainable BIM practices.}

abstract = {There is a growing class of engineering applications for which long-term managed evolution and/or managed sustainability is the primary development objective. The underlying tenet of our work is that neither of these trends will become fully mature without: (1) An understanding for how and why system entities are connected together, and (2) Formal procedures for assessing the correctness of system operations, estimating system performance, and understanding trade spaces involving competing design criteria. To address these concerns, during the past few years we have developed methodologies and tools for ontology-enabled traceability; that is, traceability mechanisms where requirements are connected to models of engineering entities by threading the traceability connection through one or more ontologies. In our proof-of-concept work the engineering entities were restricted to elements of system structure. But, of course, real engineering systems also have behaviors. This paper will report on research to understand the role that software patterns (e.g., model-view-controller) and mixtures of graph and tree visualization can play in the implementation of traceability mechanisms from requirements to elements of finite-state machine behavior (e.g., actions, states, transitions and guard conditions). We will present a simple lamp example.}

abstract = {The use of BIM in the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) industry is becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, interoperability with Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) remains a significant challenge in the domain. Furthermore, available applications require high expertise to correctly implement the data export, don't allow incremental database updates and are overall non-cost-effective, moreover in the case of small and medium-sized structures. At the same time, given the need to invest in a more sustainable built environment, it is necessary to consider the whole lifecycle of constructions, including the operation and maintenance phase, while designing. In the framework of this scenario, the paper presents a research work which defines a method to implement interoperability between BIM and CMMS software by using the IFC open standard, to allow an easier management of buildings, from design to decommissioning. This method, devised to be as feasible as possible, combines an operational procedure and a practical tool. The work was supported by the software house Prometeo Srl and the Facility Management company GEMMO SpA. The method was developed based on the Feltre Hospital (Italy) and results, that were technically validated through an ad hoc BIM model, can be used by other practitioners to further implement the method in other research.}

Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) applications can support PLM by integrating heterogeneous knowledge from different stages throughout the product life. However, the integration of knowledge from different stages and teams can cause misunderstanding if not represented in a unified form. Furthermore, different forms of knowledge used by different software are neither machine-readable nor human-readable, which also sets obstacles to knowledge integration in KBE applications. Supply chain sustainability assessment is such a scenario that entails integrating knowledge from different sources. This paper firstly implements a sustainability assessment method from other scholar to calculate the supply chain sustainability performance and adapts a sustainability assessment ontology for supply chain sustainability assessment. Then, an example KBE application is developed by implementing the sustainability assessment ontology and calculation method to simulate the knowledge sharing and integration between different teams. Finally, through this example application, it is discussed that the implementation of ontology to represent knowledge in PLM application for collaborative tasks like sustainability assessment can increase the efficiency of data sharing and integration. This paper is a proof of concept for the ontology-based framework. This framework can facilitate to represent knowledge but not create new knowledge, which means it can increase the efficiency of the software development, but cannot provide a better calculation method and assessment framework for supply chain sustainability assessment.}

In many cases, welded joints are the areas to contain the fabrication defects or cracks initiating and growing during service operation.

abstract = {Context
Software producing organizations have the ability to address the energy impact of their software products through their source code and software architecture. In spite of that, the focus often remains on hardware aspects, which limits the contribution of software towards energy efficient ICT solutions.
Objective
No methods exist to provide software architects information about the energy consumption of the different components in their software product. The objective of this paper is to bring software producing organizations in control of this qualitative aspect of their software.
Method
To achieve the objective, we developed the StEP Method to systematically investigate the effects of software units through the use of software stubs in relation to energy concerns. To evaluate the proposed method, an experiment involving three different versions of a commercial software product has been conducted. In the experiment, two versions of a software product were stubbed according to stakeholder concerns and stressed according to a test case, whilst energy consumption measurements were performed. The method provided guidance for the experiment and all activities were documented for future purposes.
Results
Comparing energy consumption differences across versions unraveled the energy consumption related to the products’ core functionality. Using the energy profile, stakeholders could identify the major energy consuming elements and prioritize software engineering efforts to maximize impact.
Conclusions
We introduce the StEP Method and demonstrate its applicability in an industrial setting. The method identified energy hotspots and thereby improved the control stakeholders have over the sustainability of a software product. Despite promising results, several concerns are identified that require further attention to improve the method. For instance, we recommend the investigation of software operation data to determine, and possibly automatically create, stubs.}

Whereas the application of the FAIR principles as a guideline to provide all collected data with rich metadata that allow for finding, accessing, interoperating with and reusing the data effectively is constantly growing within science and research, the usage in an industrial scenario is largely unexplored. Today, collected industrial data is often stored in arbitrary data formats without appropriate metadata describing the data content and is therefore lost for future reuse because crucial information on how to find, access and interoperate with the data is missing. Moreover, insufficiently described or missing data can lead to wrong decisions. In order to implement the FAIR principles for industrial sensor data, this article derives the major deficits and challenges of making industrial sensor data FAIR. Furthermore, the authors propose a three-layer architecture of FAIR sensor services, which handles the discussed challenges, to acquire FAIR sensor data at the time of measurement. The conceptual draft is evaluated by a prototypical implementation of a FAIR sensor service.}

In the current paper, the impact of using BIM to enhance the building energy efficiency is explored through a scientometric analysis and a systematic literature review. There is a high interest among the scientific community in these fields, given the recent rise in publications and citation numbers. Moreover, there is a lack of interoperability between BIM and energy analysis tools, a high potential for integrating BIM with other technologies, such as thermography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and monitoring, and a very positive impact from the use of BIM in the optimisation of construction solutions which allow energy savings in the AECO sector.}

abstract = {Context
Software-intensive space systems can harbor defects and vulnerabilities that may enable external adversaries or malicious insiders to disrupt or disable system functions, risking mission compromise or loss. Mitigating this risk demands a sustained focus on the security and resiliency of the system architecture including software, hardware, and other components.
Objective
In this paper we offer methodical approaches for improving space system resiliency through software architecture design, system engineering, and increased software security, thereby reducing the risk of latent software defects and vulnerabilities.
Method
We conducted a systematic review of existing architectural practices, standards, security and coding practices, various threats, defects, and vulnerabilities that impact space systems from hundreds of relevant publications and interviews of subject matter experts. We expanded on the system-level body of knowledge for resiliency and identified a new software architecture framework and acquisition methodology to improve the resiliency of space systems from a software perspective with an emphasis on the early phases of the systems engineering life cycle. This methodology involves seven steps: 1) Define technical resiliency requirements, 1a) Identify standards/policy for software resiliency, 2) Develop a request for proposal (RFP)/statement of work (SOW) for resilient space systems software, 3) Define software resiliency goals for space systems, 4) Establish software resiliency quality attributes, 5) Perform architectural tradeoffs and identify risks, 6) Conduct architecture assessments as part of the procurement process, and 7) Ascertain space system software architecture resiliency metrics.
Results
Data illustrates that software vulnerabilities can lead to opportunities for malicious cyber activities, which could degrade the space mission capability for its user community. Reducing the number of vulnerabilities by improving architecture and software system engineering practices can contribute to making space systems more resilient.
Conclusion
Since cyber-attacks [1] are enabled by shortfalls in software, robust software engineering practices and an architectural design are foundational to resiliency, which is a quality that allows the system to take a hit to a critical component and recover in a known, bounded, and generally acceptable period of time. To achieve software resiliency for space systems, acquirers and suppliers must identify relevant factors and systems engineering practices to apply across the life cycle, in software requirements analysis, architecture development, design, implementation, verification and validation, and maintenance phases.}

Consequently, a particular domain of expertise in engineering and scientific fields has emerged, demanding more advanced skills and deeper domain knowledge. The essential role of Architectural Design (AD) and Urban Planning (UP) is to enable a forward-looking approach to building/facility creation. Construction Engineering (CE) expresses its routine primarily through a transition phase that transforms ideas to sustainable urban artifacts. The CE role appears as a combination of backward and downward looking to the same process/product. All three domains are highly cooperative in the context of Environmental Engineering (EE). Currently available software tools that support the AD, UP and CE domains are far from simple. Several recent software engineering studies suggest that, instead of developing a complex “all in one solution”, the federation or orchestration of several related simple methods and tools seems promising. In this article, we discuss the basic AD, UP and CE domain-cooperation aspects and suggest an Extensible Orchestration Framework (ExOF) model that may support them. To verify the ExOF simulation and orchestration potential, we used its architectural model to orchestrate different software tools when performing the urban blocks daylight illumination simulation for different urban block morphology models. For the exact simulation, we used the normalized sun-exposition data for the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. Also presented is an illustration of the methodology, modeling and orchestration potential of ExOF for the selected case study, together with the results, obtained for typical 3D models of selected urban block morphology patterns.}

The process encompasses a two-stage Rankine cycle boosted by a thermoelectric generator and an ejector refrigeration unit, and a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. This system is simulated in engineering equation solver software and a comprehensive sensitivity study is accomplished. It is concluded that the most influential parameter in the whole framework is the operational temperature of the stack and in the integrated process is turbine 1 pressure. Afterward, an advanced evolutionary optimization method is employed using the MATLAB software, and the optimal point is designated from the sustainability and economic standpoints. The optimal state reveals the sustainability index of 2.61 and total unit cost of 35.93 $/GJ, improved by 12.5% and 3.8% against the base case, respectively.

A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon.}

The proposed method has been applied to the function of Linux to demonstrate the information leakage risk propagation.

This reflection paper provides an opportunity to obtain new insights into the trends in software sustainability in both academia and industry, from a software architecture perspective specifically and software engineering more broadly. Given advances in research in the field, the increasing introduction of academic courses on different sustainability topics, and the engagement of companies to cope with sustainability goals, we reflect on advances and maturity about the role sustainability in general plays in today’s society. More specifically, we revisit the trends, open issues and research challenges identified five years ago in our previous paper on software sustainability research and practice from a software architecture viewpoint, which aimed to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures in order to consider how this paper influenced and motivated research in the intervening years.
Method:
The forward snowballing method was used to establish the methodological basis for our reflection on the state of the art. A total of 234 studies were identified between April 2018 and June 2023 and 102 studies were found to be relevant according to the selection criteria. A further subset was mapped to the primary themes of the original paper including definitions and concepts, reference architectures, measures and metrics, and education.
Vision:
The vision of this reflection paper is to provide a new foundation and road map of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software engineering highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Since sustainability became a challenge in software engineering, researchers mainly from requirements engineering and software architecture communities have contributed to defining the basis of the notion of sustainability-aware software.
Problem
Despite these valuable efforts, the assessment and design based on the notion of sustainability as a software quality is still poorly understood. There is no consensus on which sustainability requirements should be considered.
Aim and Method
To fill this gap, a survey was designed with a double objective: i) determine to which extent quality requirements contribute to the sustainability of software-intensive systems; and ii) identify direct dependencies among the sustainability dimensions. The survey involved different target audiences (e.g. software architects, ICT practitioners with expertise in Sustainability). We evaluated the perceived importance/relevance of each sustainability dimension, and the perceived usefulness of exploiting a sustainability model in different software engineering activities.
Results
Most respondents considered modifiability as relevant for addressing both technical and environmental sustainability. Functional correctness, availability, modifiability, interoperability and recoverability favor positively the endurability of software systems. This study has also identified security, satisfaction, and freedom from risk as very good contributors to social sustainability. Satisfaction was also considered by the respondents as a good contributor to economic sustainability.}

However, in the real decomposition of TPVA, the temperature in the oxidation reactor is not self-sustaining; as a result, the degradation products contain a lot of CO, resulting in more pollution and energy waste. In this paper, jet stirred reactor (JSR) and Chemkin software were used to study the reaction kinetics characteristics of the oxidation process of degradation products from TPVA in the range of 550 °C–700 °C. Both experiments and kinetic simulation show that a higher average temperature of the oxidation reactor is needed to achieve lower CO emissions. When using 5% or 10% TPVA degradation solution, the average temperature should not befall below 625 °C or 675 °C. The corresponding residence time should be greater than 6 s and 5 s respectively. The combination of research findings and engineering practice provides great help to the optimization of the actual work process.}

In this paper, the potentials of MS for engineering tools are shown using the example of a web-based configurator for robot-based automation solutions. On the one hand, the implemented prototype illustrates a possible MS architecture pattern and, on the other hand, clarifies how new functionalities such as the collaborative multi-user configuration or different role-based configuration sessions are enabled by such a concept. Using the example of the web-based configuration platform, it is finally shown how a MS architecture contributes to better development and easier deployment of engineering software solutions based on the divide and conquer principle.}

Technological solutions, including software-related ones, may help tackle these concerns for humanity. However, the development of such solutions requires special attention and effort to overcome human, public, and social barriers that might prevent them from being effective. The Requirements Engineering for Well-Being, Aging, and Health (REWBAH) workshop gathering in 2021 focused on addressing the challenge of how Requirements Engineering (RE) knowledge and practices can be applied to the development of information systems that support and promote long-lasting, sustained, and healthier behavior and choices by individuals. An interactive discussion among subject matter experts and practitioners participating in the REWBAH’21 revolved around several questions. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the emerging themes were arranged in the sustainable-health RE (SusHeRE) framework to describe RE processes that address both sustainability and health goals. In this vision paper, we present our framework, which includes four main SusHeRE goals defined according to the changes in RE that we deem necessary for achieving a positive contribution of RE on sustainability and health. These goals involve improved RE Techniques, Multidisciplinary Expertise, Education Agenda, and Public and Social Ecology.}

abstract = {Sustainability has become a major focus of the cement industry, largely due to the carbon dioxide emissions associated with Portland cement production. In grouting engineering, ordinary cement slurry has high viscosity, poor fluidity and groutability and is prone to blockage. In this study, a cement slurry was designed using superfine cement (SC). Fine-grained ultrafine fly ash (UFA) waste was used, part of which is used to replace cement, and a certain amount of nontoxic mSiO2·nH2O (SH) is extracted from limestone waste and mixed with the commonly used admixture polycarboxylic acid water reducer (PAWR) to ensure its physical properties in practical engineering applications while reducing its viscosity, increasing its fluidity, and reducing the occurrence of clogging. To determine the optimal mix ratio of the cement slurries mixed with various materials, the characteristics of each material were analyzed through the single-factor test of the multiperformance test, and the orthogonal test mix ratio was designed based on the single-factor test results. Through the Taguchi grey correlation analysis method, the orthogonal test data were analyzed to find the optimal mix ratio. A performance test of the cement slurry with the optimal mix ratio was carried out, and its sustainability was analyzed. Combined with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Voronoi Calculation Method (VCM) methods, UDEC numerical simulation software is used to simulate and analyze the general laws of cement slurry fluidity. The results show that the cement slurry with the optimal mix ratio of SH, SC, PAWR and UFA materials has good fluidity and groutability, has the characteristics of sustainable development, and can be applied to practical projects.}

The algorithm was developed to provide rapid response operations without the need for extensive quantitative stability evaluations based on the rock slope sustainability ratio. The fuzzy key-block analysis method utilises a weighted rational decision (multi-criteria decision-making) function to prepare the ‘degree of reliability (degree of stability-instability contingency)’ for slopes as implemented through the Mathematica software package. The central and analyst core of the proposed algorithm is provided as based on discontinuity network geometrical uncertainties and hierarchical decision-making. This algorithm uses block theory principles to proceed to rock block classification, movable blocks and key-block identifications under ambiguous terms which investigates the sustainability ratio with accurate, quick and appropriate decisions especially for novice engineers in the context of discontinuous rock slope stability analysis. The method with very high precision and speed has particular matches with the existing procedures and has the potential to be utilised as a continuous decision-making system for discrete parameters and to minimise the need to apply common practises. In order to justify the algorithm, a number of discontinuous rock mass slopes were considered as examples. In addition, the SWedge, RocPlane softwares and expert assignments (25-member specialist team) were utilised for verification of the applied algorithm which led to a conclusion that the algorithm was successful in providing rational decision-making.}

Mechanical activation was applied to activate the HTS, and partial cement was replaced by the reactive HTS. The engineering performance indices of the HTS-SCB slurry, such as the slump, hydraulic conductivity, compressive strength, porosity and leaching risks of heavy metals, were evaluated in this study. The hydration products were identified through a series of analytical tests. The three-dimensional microscale structure of the sample was obtained from the CT experiment, and the microscale geometrical properties were analysed using pore-network models and Avizo software. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was applied to simulate the fluid flow in the HTS-SCB slurry, and the simulated hydraulic conductivities and three-dimensional streamlines were obtained. The results showed that the HTS-SCB slurry had an optimal anti-seepage performance, appropriate mechanical performance and low leaching risks of heavy metals when the cement was replaced by 50 % reactive HTS. The hydration reaction between calcium hydroxide and HTS generates large amounts of fresh calcium silicate hydrates containing Fe and Ti, which fill the pores and contribute to low hydraulic conductivity, micropores (diameter ≤ 2.8 μm) and microflow paths (diameter ≤ 2.5 μm). The LBM results show that the calculated hydraulic conductivities match well with the measured values, and a high tortuosity is obtained from the three-dimensional velocity fields.

This can be done by monitoring the usage context of the system and having runtime support to react to those changes that impact the energy footprint negatively. Although both the hardware and the software parts of cyber-physical systems can be adapted to reduce its energy consumption, this paper focuses on software adaptation. Concretely, the paper illustrates how to address the problem of developing context-aware energy-efficient applications using a Green Eco-Assistant that makes use of advanced software engineering methods, such as Dynamic Software Product Lines and Separation of Concerns. The main steps of our approach are illustrated by applying them to a cyber-physical system case study.}

Unfortunately, these benefits come at the expense of a migration from a family of products to a SPL. Feature Location could be useful in achieving the transition to SPLs. This work presents our FeLLaCaM approach for Feature Location. Our approach calculates similarity to a description of the feature to locate, occurrences where the candidate features remain unchanged, and changes performed to the candidate features throughout the retrospective of the product family. We evaluated our approach in two long-living industrial domains: a model-based family of firmwares for induction hobs that was developed over more than 15 years, and a model-based family of PLC software to control trains that was developed over more than 25 years. In our evaluation, we compare our FeLLaCaM approach with two other approaches for Feature Location: (1) FLL (Feature Location through Latent Semantic Analysis) and (2) FLC (Feature Location through Comparisons). We measure the performance of FeLLaCaM, FLL, and FLC in terms of recall, precision, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve. The results show that FeLLaCaM outperforms FLL and FLC.}

The approaches taken by the various new entrants are reviewed, with reference to recruitment strategies, infrastructure, the use of external facilities, and the particular flavours of chemical engineering being offered by the new providers. Information about the differentiating features of the large number of chemical engineering degree courses now available is somewhat indistinct: this should be rectified in the interests both of prospective students and of employers. Dilemmas facing new providers include the need to address the fundamentals of the subject as well as moving into more novel research-led areas; enabling students to develop the competencies to sustain them for a whole career as well as meeting immediate employer needs; and providing sufficient industry understanding when academics may lack substantial industrial experience. The central importance of practical provision and of the design project, and the approaches taken by new providers to deliver these components, are reviewed, together with the role of software tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate industry input into courses. As long as it is not used prescriptively or to inhibit innovation, the accreditation process provides constructive guidance and leverage for universities developing new chemical engineering programmes.}

The proposed system is studied comprehensively and analyzed thermodynamically to identify the effectiveness of the system and its potential implementation. The current system is simulated using the Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS. The thermodynamic calculations are carried out by using the engineering equation solver (EES) software package. This system primarily uses solar energy to produce electricity and as an input energy to the pyrolysis reactor that converts plastic wastes to syngas. Also, the system includes a thermal storage unit to maintain the operation during low solar irradiation. The syngas produced from plastic wastes pyrolysis is processed through a combined cycle to produce electricity. The system generates the electricity at a capacity of 21,601.9 kW. The methane produced is processed through a steam reforming unit to produce hydrogen at a total rate of 0.6 kg/s. The water desalination sub-system produces fresh water through multi effect desalination at a rate of 22.95 kg/s. The energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the overall system are found to be 62.65% and 42.30% respectively.}

Literature has demonstrated a massive amount of digital educational environments in several contexts as being complementary to conventional educational methods. Nevertheless, hosting technical content produced by engineering simulations with educational AR/VR is still challenging and requires expertise from multiple disciplines throughout the technical development. Present work provides a facile and agile methodology for low-cost hardware but content-wise rich AR software development.

A potential application of this conceptually designed system is for a community identified in the Tuscany region of Italy's Larderello field. The proposed system is then analyzed and assessed by utilizing sensitive the thermodynamic simulations and software. The effects of operational and state-related parameters, such as steam, oxygen, waste tire input rate, reference temperature, and gasifier temperature are examined to analyse and evaluate the integrated waste tire gasification system's performance. The present study further aims to determine the effects of varying system parameters and operating circumstances on the ethanol and hydrogen production rates, with the goal of increasing energy and exergy efficiencies while minimizing hazardous wastes and gas emissions. Furthermore, numerous parametric studies on the waste tire-powered multigeneration system are undertaken accordingly. Both Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Aspen Plus software packages are utilized as potential tools to perform analysis andsimulation studiesfor this system. The proposed system is fed with 10 kg/s of waste tires, and the energy production is supported by using 14.7 kg/s of geothermal spring water. While the net electricity generation, cooling and heating capacities of this system are obtained to be 18752 kW, 49236 kW and 5363 kW, respectively, while the total hydrogen and ethanol production rates within the integrated system are found to be 3.02 kg/s and 0.13 kg/s. The results also show that the waste tire-based integrated gasification system's overall energetic and exergetic efficiencies become 71.45 % and 69.87 %, respectively.}

Technical excellence is a nebulous term in agile software development. This vagueness is risky because it may lead to misunderstandings and to agile implementations that may overlook a key principle of agile development.
Objective:
This study investigates how agile practitioners interpret the concept of technical excellence brought up in Principle 9 of the Agile manifesto. Moreover, we investigate how agile practitioners put the concept into practice and what conditions facilitate putting technical excellence into practice.
Methods:
We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty agile practitioners, coded the data inductively, and performed two sessions to validate the emerging findings.
Results:
We find that technical excellence is first and foremost a mindset that is underpinned by continuous attention to sustainable code, continuous learning, and teamwork. Fostering technical excellence requires the adoption of design and development practices, such as continuous architecting, and is supported by continuous learning. We also identify three enabling conditions for technical excellence: Leadership support, customer buy-in, and psychological safety. These enablers provide teams with leeway to nurture their pursuit of technical excellence.
Conclusion:
Our findings highlight the key role of people-based strategies in promoting technical excellence in agile software development. They show that the attainment of technical excellence does not only involve technical practices. On the contrary, it relies on social and organizational support and, most importantly, a mindset.}

While the discussion on how to operationalize the new intelligent systems of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is still going on; the dominant characteristics of the fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 – going beyond producing goods and services for profit – requires all to think and act differently. As a result of the convergence phenomenon, the boundaries between different disciplines are eroding, necessitating a thorough discussion on what engineering education should be like in the future. In this paper, after presenting a brief history of engineering education, the recent paradigm changes are discussed, which essentially stress that skills must prevail over degrees to deal with challenges posed by the trends of the fifth industrial revolution. Later, before concluding the paper four strategies are presented such as lifelong learning and transdisciplinary education (1), sustainability, resilience, and human-centric design modules (2), hands-on data fluency and management courses (3) and human-agent/machine/robot/computer interaction experiences (4).}

A Methodology for Energy Efficient Building Refurbishment (MEEBR) has been identified and tested on two case studies with students of the Integrated Design Refurbishment Laboratory of Building Engineering Faculty at POLIMI. In particular, the performance energy analyses were conducted on two university building case: the first at POLIMI campus, and the second located in the Università degli Studi di Milano (UNIMI) campus. These analyses were carried out using numerical simulations, considering the increasing important role which software are playing in refurbishment building design process also in early design phase. This preliminary experience with students on MEEBR application, with also the overview on building refurbishment methodologies, show that case study examples can help to: increase consideration of the integrated research approach and improve sustainability performance in historical buildings taking into account also the user’s participation of a university campus. The comparison of the energy assessment methodology, of the two software used for the analyses (CENED+ and Sefaira), leads to the statement that it is essential from the beginning, selecting a program in function of the particular job and the outputs that you want to reach with the tool.}

Owing to the critical role of software-intensive systems in society, software engineers have the accountability to consider sustainability as a goal while structuring a software system. However, there are no practical guidelines providing a tangible decomposition of the sustainability aspect. Moreover, there are limited quantifiable methods to support sustainable design and analysis.
Objectives:
The purpose of this study is to help software practitioners to take sustainability into account by providing systematic guidelines for the software engineering process. We propose a framework that presents a meta model to decompose sustainability requirements and an assessment approach to evaluate sustainability achievements.

This work presents an integrated framework that combines a goal-based approach, scenario-based approach, and feature modeling to gather sustainability related requirements and corresponding features. For sustainability assessment, software analysis and machine learning techniques are utilized to analyze software products based on sustainability metrics and criteria.
Results and Conclusions:
The empirical study conducted with participants from academia and industry revealed that the proposed framework improves participant’s ability to consider sustainability aspect in their software engineering tasks through focusing on requirements, design, and evaluation. With the provided sustainability meta-model, the participants could extract more stakeholders, requirements, and features in shorter time.

abstract = {Paper deals in-depth with the topic of sustained stress indices applicable to 90° elbows based on non-linear finite element analysis models. A comprehensive overview of the existing literature sources is given in the first part of the paper, showing that there are little sources which deal specifically with this topic and that the ones that do exist result in important scatter of the results. As a result, more than few of the existing sources are non-conservative in their nature. Dedicated non-linear finite element studies have been performed on shell and solid models which are used in conjunction with the regression analysis in order to obtain explicit equations which can be used to calculate both in- and out-plane sustained stress indices in 90° pipe elbows, which can then be used in the typical pipe stress analysis. Newly proposed equations prove to be a good fit for the numerical data, showing little deviation as shown by the correlation parameters presented in the paper. Final part of the paper presents a dedicated section on the high wall thickness elbows and shows the relationship between elbow wall thickness and maximum stress location. It is shown that beyond certain thickness, the maximum stress location shifts from the typical failure location (i.e., side wall) to the locations which are not typically expected (i.e., intrados or even away from elbow). This shifting may have an important effect on the theoretical models which assume failure location.}

Nonetheless, they have poor performance when machined. In this study, magnetic field diamond turning (MFDT) was used to increase the thermal conductivity and thus the machinability of machined Ti-6Al-4 V alloy parts, as well as the lifetime of the diamond cutting tool. The thermal properties of the work material under a magnetic field were investigated using ABAQUS software. The simulation results were validated by the cutting experiments, which demonstrated improved machining performance, increased tool life, and enhanced thermal properties of the machined parts. The surface morphology such as surface defects and surface roughness and microstructure modifications were investigated as evidence. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the MFDT on the machinability of titanium alloys as the thermal conductivity increases, resulting in increased tool life and improved machined surface quality reached to more than 60% for achieving sustainable diamond machining.}

abstract = {Digitization within the framework of Industry 4.0 is considered the biggest and fastest driver of change in history of manufacturing industry. While the size of a company is becoming less essential, the ability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and new technologies is more important than ever. This trend particularly applies to the companies’ software landscapes, where individual sub-processes and services must be orchestrated, seamlessly integrated, and iteratively renewed according to the ever-increasing user requirements. However, inflexible, closed monolithic software applications as well as self-programmed stand-alone tools that are difficult to integrate are still predominant in the engineering domain. A complete reimplementation of existing, proprietary engineering tools and their integration into monolithic applications of large software providers is often not economically feasible, especially for small and medium-sized machinery and plant manufacturers. In this context, the so-called Process-Driven Approach (PDA) offers a sustainable and tool-neutral opportunity for process and tool orchestration, enabling an easy integration of individual software applications by consistent utilization of the separation of concerns principle. The PDA, originating from business informatics, is mainly based on the standardized and machine-executable visual modeling language Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Using the semantic enhancements found in version 2.0, BPMN is not just used to model the business processes but also to model and execute the integration processes between different systems. After the PDA has already been successfully applied to large-scale projects in business informatics, it is now being transferred to the engineering domain. As shown in this paper, PDA allows to orchestrate the different processes in engineering and to integrate the underlying software tools, such as e-mail or spreadsheet applications, engineering tools, or custom microservices, using standardized interfaces like REST API. In doing so, engineering processes can be made more transparent, monitored, and optimized by means of appropriate key figures. The concept is validated by a prototypical implementation of a minimum functional PDA architecture for the engineering domain.}

This manufacturing process is also frequently used when it is needed to manufacture unique parts to replace degraded or damaged components and spare parts that are no longer available. In this reverse engineering process, particular attention must be given to the constitutive models of materials. The 3D printing manufacturing process usually requires a change of materials and introduces or increases the anisotropy. In addition, the complexity of part geometries and loading often requires using the finite element method to simulate their behaviour in service. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the materials frequently used in 3D Printing for its sustainability, affordability, and mechanical and thermal properties. In this study, a bushing of a hinged drawer support is reverse-engineered, and its in-service behaviour is simulated before it is manufactured using Tough PLA material through 3D printing. Furthermore, the effect of the anisotropy and the friction in the design is evaluated.

abstract = {Context
A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners.
Method
We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015.
Results
We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems.
Conclusion
SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.}

abstract = {The presented engineering discipline one-off construction is characterized by a multiplicity of manual processes. As almost all modern product developments, the manufacture is based on the creation and consistent use of digital models. Quality of underlying data can vary greatly and it is not certain that digital models match the actual state of construction. This can result in the need for rework after production or installation. Especially challenging in the area of premium products, for which high quality, scarce materials are used and tight schedules are defined. If physical products are reworked, the corresponding digital models must be manually maintained. At present, attempts are being made to counteract these late adjustments by means of physical mock-ups or visual inspection of 3D scan data. Such scan data is used for automated adaptation of underlying digital models to the actual state of the physical construction. Existing Point Cloud Library functionalities were adapted and further algorithms were designed. The developed software backend was integrated into the existing software architecture. During the software development, great care was taken to ensure that the backend is based on open source content. The results show significant improvements of the data basis for the subsequent engineering activities. This will lead to a significant reduction of manual effort and rework, ensuring development cycles and even shorten delivery times. It reduces costs in the product creation process and sustainably strengthens confidence in digital models used. It has been shown that automation of design processes can have productivity-enhancing effects in one-off construction.}

In this way, for example, modern engineering systems should commonly be developed in terms of innovative (lightweight) designs and, at the same time, offer a wide range of environmental as well as economic advantages across the whole product lifecycle (PLC). Accordingly, selecting the most beneficial functional principles, processes and materials within a given product structure, if any, and based on multiple criteria is a highly complex process. Therefore, and even due to the strong interdependencies between the engineering disciplines and the individual objectives, a ‘true’ holistic and integrated sustainable selection of the actual (functional) design, manufacturing and material aspect is inevitable. Concerning this matter, a stand-alone software tool in terms of a set-based method is developed which supports the engineer by screening potential combinations of functional principles, manufacturing processes and materials regarding multidimensional, i.e. ecological, economic and technical, data to address this issue.}

Therefore, a finite element (FE) analysis based on ABAQUS software is conducted to study the creep performance of SRCFST columns considering the initial stress of steel tube. Based on the verified FE model, the whole process load-deformation curves, load distributions of each component and longitudinal strain versus time curves are obtained. The stress distributions of each component are analyzed at the feature points. The effects of main parameters on the creep behaviour are studied, including the sustained load level, initial stress ratio, compressive strength of concrete, steel ratio of steel tube and encased steel section. The studies show that the SRCFST member exhibits an elastoplastic behaviour subjected to the coupling effect of initial stress on steel tube and sustained load. However, the creep ratio undergoes a change from linear to nonlinear by increasing long-term load or initial stress ratio. Finally, a method for calculating the creep in SRCFST columns under combined loads is provided, and the long-term performance can be better predicted.}

In the livestock domain, technologies are developed to sustainably raise animal production. However, the domain is critical, since animals are very sensitive to variables such as temperature and humidity, which can cause diseases and consequent production losses and discomfort. Livestock production systems then demand monitoring, reasoning, and acting on the environment so that the levels of those variables are preserved in pre-established intervals and undesired conditions are predicted, avoided, and mitigated with automated actions.
Objective:
The main contribution of this article is presenting E-SECO, a software ecosystem platform, and its evolution that encapsulates a new self-adaptive component to tackle animal production decisions, named e-Livestock architecture.
Method:
Two case studies were conducted involving a real system derived from the E-SECO platform encompassing a Compost Barn production system, i.e., the environment and surrounding technology where bovine milk production takes place.
Results:
Results showed the effectiveness of E-SECO to (i) abstract disruptive technologies based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence and accommodate them in a single architecture for that specific domain, (ii) support reuse and derivation of a self-adaptive architecture to support engineering a complex system for a livestock sub-domain (milk production), and (iii) support empirical studies in a real smart farm towards a future transfer of technology to industry.
Conclusion:
The results showed that the E-SECO platform, which encompasses e-livestock architecture, can support monitoring, reasoning, prediction, and automated actions in a milk production/Compost Barn environment.}

The full commercialization of natural composites as alternative materials to conventional ones is undermined by environmental factors such as moisture content leading to varied shrinkage and swelling behaviors. Uncontrolled shrinkage behavior can often lead to premature split in natural composites. The aim of this study is to investigate the fracture mechanisms due to directional shrinkage in natural composite material through numerical simulation by considering the finite element modelling software of LS-DYNA. From numerical results, directional shrinkage could be seen to clearly affect the fracture patterns in natural composites as compared to the control one. The fracture patterns, which indicated a narrowed region of stress concentration in the material, is assumed to emanate from internally induced forces in the material, namely tensile and compressive forces. This specific pattern is associated to longitudinal split failure typically observed in orthotropic materials. Results of this study can be useful to further investigate the complex fracture behavior in natural composite materials to better understand their durability limitations.}

Nevertheless, due to their relatively high complexity and implementation costs, RAS are only used to a limited extent by small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. As a rule, the high costs of RAS arise from custom engineering efforts, which take up to 70 percent of the acquisition costs. For this reason, it is necessary to optimise the engineering of RAS. However, software tools such as configurators have been used primarily for the individualisation of products, such as automobiles or clothing, based on variants predefined by the manufacturer, and less for the engineering of automation solutions. The development of knowledge-based systems, in particular knowledge-based engineering configurators (EC), is usually performed by few proficient experts with high development effort. One of the primary challenges in the knowledge acquisition is that several experts possess partial aspects of knowledge in an inhomogeneous, implicit form. Furthermore, there is a lack of efficient development methods for EC. By reusing knowledge elements from previous development projects, a sustainable increase in efficiency is possible. In order to enable an efficient development process of EC, we introduce a structuring model consisting of four knowledge domains (KD): knowledge about specific business cases (KD1), Best Practices as case-specific solution knowledge (KD2), logical expert knowledge (KD3) as well as semantically consistent data models for interoperability of different IT systems (KD4). As the four KD are independent, their development can be agilely divided among several teams or companies. Finally, the agile development approach is validated individually for each KD as well as comprehensively within the scope of the ROBOTOP platform for planning RAS.}

However, some phases in the AE lack interoperability and information exchange efficiency. This inefficiency is much more critical in the case of design and structural projects. In this respect, this study aims to conduct and integrate BIM into an AE process to analyse and improve the degree of efficiency of a structural project. For this purpose, a real case study on a high-standing villa was conducted. The BIM process was implemented based on the spirit of collaboration and interoperability with both Revit® and Robot® software. The results describe the BIM process’s ease of modelling, verification, transfer, exchange, and error detection. Thus, the speed, ease of modification, and decision-making. Thus, the rate of improvement and decision-making. The paper joins the body of studies seeking to reposition the AEC industry. It develops a Framework between Revit and Robot at the professional level, valid for all structural projects.

abstract = {Manufacturing companies are increasingly pushed towards more sustainable production by socio-political and environmental factors. In order to assess their sustainability performance, companies often use the widespread life cycle assessment (LCA) as defined by ISO 14040 and supported by various LCA software solutions. However, this is regularly associated with well-known shortcomings such as difficulties in gaining appropriate life cycle inventory data, lack of result transferability, and the amount of time needed for LCA studies. To overcome these problems, approaches for automating the LCA process have proven to be promising in other engineering disciplines (e.g., civil engineering). However, hardly any approaches to automating the LCA of manufacturing processes exist. Based on an extensive literature review, this paper presents a concept for an automated LCA of manufacturing processes. The approach consists of three steps and covers the phases of data extraction, LCA model building, and analysis. It is geared towards using implicitly existing manufacturing information and facilitating the so far mostly manual data collection and modeling processes. To conclude, an outlook is given on how the proposed concept will be further developed in an industrial setting.}

The proposed pattern language integrates knowledge from various domains, such as modeling, software engineering, and Bayesian networks, to provide a comprehensive solution for developing OOBNs. The paper also provides a validation framework to evaluate the pattern language. As a practical application for the OOBN pattern language, a case study of using it to develop an OOBN is presented. The model in the case study aims to represent the complex interconnections among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), long-term sustainability and resilience. The results of the case study validate the effectiveness of the pattern language and highlight its potential for future applications. The proposed OOBN pattern language provides a systematic approach to the development of OOBN, reducing the complexity and increasing the efficiency of their modeling process}

This paper proposes a methodology for introducing creativity and innovation techniques in the Requirements Engineering process in order to build more agile and efficient Information Systems. The method uses a variety of creative techniques that are thought to be appropriate to the different stages of the process and is inspired by existing creative problem-solving methods and techniques, in particular in the Creative Problem-Solving Process, Productive Thinking Model and the Creative Potentiation Method. The study of the method allowed its application, through the use of various creativity techniques, in a real context in a social institution - the Social Center for Support to the Community of São Domingos. The application of the methodology allowed the identification of new opportunities that allowed the organization to devise service delivery strategies that were more suited to the needs of people.}

To that end, modern software needs to provide creative features to improve sustainability. To advance software creativity, research has proposed several techniques, including multi-day workshops involving experienced requirements analysts, and semi-automated tools to support creative thinking in a limited scope. Such approaches are either useful only for software with already rich issue tracking systems, or require substantial engagement from analysts with creative minds. In a recent work, we have demonstrated a novel framework that is beneficial for both novel and existing software and allows end-to-end automation promoting creativity. The framework reuses requirements from similar software freely available online, utilizes advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, and leverages the concept of requirement boilerplate to generate candidate creative requirements. An application of our framework on software domains: Antivirus, Web Browser, and File Sharing followed by a human subject evaluation have shown promising results. In this invited extension, we present further analysis for our research questions and report an additional evaluation by human subjects. The results exhibit the framework’s ability in generating creative features even for a relatively matured application domain, such as Web Browser, and provoking creative thinking among developers irrespective of their experience levels.}

Each transformation has inputs and produces outputs. The use of this approach supports a very flexible software engineering metrics repository.}

To explore the potential of this solution, the synergistic effect of bio-ethanol and spark-induced compression ignition (SICI) combustion with reliance on efficient supervisory control systems is evaluated for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. This article is pioneered with the forward engineering of SICI combustion engine for plug-in hybrid biofuel-electric vehicles (PHBEVs) by optimizing the high-efficiency region of SICI combustion system for the PHBEV with dynamic programming (DP)-based case studies, after which the DHE prototype is produced using one-dimension and three-dimension engine digital twin models. Further, experimental test data of the optimized DHE is used to model the PHBEV in GT-Suite and MATLAB/Simulink software, and its charge-sustaining (CS) performance with rule-based control and adaptive equivalent minimization control strategy (A-ECMS) under both homologation and real-world driving cycles is evaluated and compared with the offline DP. The results show that the SICI combustion engine-based PHBEV with ethanol blending from E20 to E100 can reduce the well-to-wheel (WTW) CO2 emissions by 28% to 75%, respectively, where more than 7% of the reduction is contributed by control system optimization using A-ECMS. Moreover, the digital twin-based simulation platform developed in this work can be applied to evaluate and optimize the advanced combustion engines and supervisory controllers for hybrid biofuel-electric vehicles.}

abstract = {Ti-6Al-4V alloy has widespread uses in a variety of engineering applications such as in the manufacturing of aerospace, automotive, and prosthetics body-parts owing to its unique characteristics. However, the machining of Ti-6Al-4V generates high cutting temperature due to poor thermal conductivity. This high cutting temperature triggers chemical reactivity of the alloy with the tool material and accelerates the edge wear. Therefore, the cryogenic coolants are used to improve the cutting performance, but their poor lubrication allows for high cutting forces. Hybrid lubri-coolants could be an alternative to reduce the temperature efficiently. The simulation of hybrid lubri-coolants by Finite Element Modeling (FEM) is an interesting to explore the high-performance cutting of hard titanium alloy. The current study compares the cutting temperatures using DEFORM® FEM simulations software and to foresee the cutting temperatures in milling Ti-6Al-4V at various levels of cutting speeds Vc (100–300 m/min), and feed per tooth fz 0.08–0.12 mm/z and under effect of hybrid lubri-coolants (ethanol, ester oil, and hybrid ethanol-ester oil). Initially, the 2D milling models were developed and predicted results were compared to milling experiments. The comparison of experimental and simulation cutting temperatures revealed a maximum of 6.5 % error. Thus, it can be concluded that 2D modeling is an effective tool to predict the milling temperatures within a reasonable error.}

The waste-to-electrical efficiency of conventional incineration plants is limited to 20–25% due to the higher amount of moisture content in the feedstock and flue gas heat losses. In addition, tubes of the incineration boiler are subjected to corrosion problems at elevated temperatures. In the present research, a parabolic trough solar-integrated municipal solid waste power plant is proposed and thermodynamically evaluated for different useful outputs. The solar energy is harvested through parabolic trough collectors to reheat the working fluid of the incineration plant to increase the steam temperature before it is fed to the low-pressure turbine. Meanwhile, a single-effect absorption chiller is integrated to utilize the thermal energy of the trough collectors for cooling purposes. In addition, the thermal energy of flue gas is used to power an organic Rankine cycle that further drives a proton exchange membrane and reverse osmosis desalination unit for hydrogen and freshwater production, respectively. In this way, the steam temperature for reheating the low-pressure turbine is increased to further improve the performance of the proposed solar-integrated waste-to-energy plant without causing any corrosion problems to the incineration boiler. The integrated facility is thermodynamically analyzed based on a 560-tons/day incineration plant using the engineering equation solver (EES) software. The results indicate that the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed plant are 32.51% and 23.7%, respectively, while the coefficient of performance of the absorption chiller is 0.849. Moreover, it is concluded that the produced desalinated water and hydrogen rates are 23.96 kg/s and 0.000857 kg/s, respectively.}

As a typical MUSR, the metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablet is an advanced system with limited researches devoted to relating its structure to the drug release phase other than the preparation process and modulation to the release behaviors. This research details a three-dimension method to image the internal structure and detail drug release features of commercial metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets and component individual single pellets. As such, a new perspective for MUSR dosage form is provided. Using high energy synchrotron radiation X-ray microcomputed tomography (SR-μCT), the in-situ structure parameters were obtained nondestructively. It was demonstrated that the average number of spherical pellets in a tablet was 853 ± 12 (n = 3). The average volume of the pellets was 0.09 ± 0.01 mm3, the diameter was 0.55 ± 0.03 mm, and the sphericity was 0.87 ± 0.06. These data reflected the numerical features of pellets in MUSR tablets, which were helpful for reverse engineering to MUSR. Based on the three dimensional model generated by image processing and analysis software, the pellet structures were divided into three layers of typical depot sustained release system: pellet core, drug-containing layer and outer film. The dynamic structural features determined refer to the changes of structures in pellets during in vitro drug release, with evidence that the coating layer on the pellets maintained a spherical morphology whilst numerous valleys appeared on the surface. The material constitution and distribution in coating layer were evaluated by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared mapping and results indicated a composition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose dispersed in ethyl cellulose. Knowledge of these structural characteristics confirmed that the mechanism of sustained drug release was membrane controlled and consistent with the drug release profiles. In conclusion, the structural investigation provided knowledge of the intrinsic quality of metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets and offers guidance for reverse engineering of MUSR.}

This article explains the comparative advantages of Geosynthetic Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls over four other conventional types (Plain Concrete Gravity walls; Reinforced Concrete Cantilever walls; Masonry Brick walls; and Gabion Limestone Cage walls) from a sustainability perspective over various heights. The study comprises a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) following the ISO 14040 and 14044 frameworks. The results revealed that constructing MSE walls rather than the other conventional walls contributes to 10 of the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GaBi's software and embedded database were utilized for the first time in such an assessment. The article demonstrated that the construction of gravity walls requires large amounts of cement/concrete, which emit a significant amount of geogenic CO2. In contrast, the construction of MSE walls requires considerably less concrete and more backfill. The construction of cantilever walls requires less concrete than gravity, yet more than MSE walls for their construction. The structure of masonry walls was found to have less impact on the environment than the construction of comparable gravity and cantilever walls. The benefits of MSE walls over conventional walls increased with increasing wall height. The significant benefit comes from using soil backfill as the chief structural component rather than concrete. This article is deemed an essential step in achieving circularity and circular economy regarding sustainable earth fill retaining structures.}

The presented methodology enables the engineer to analyze the suppliers for decision making in the purchasing process as well as the identification of weak points regarding sustainability in the handling systems. The methodology offers the possibility of analyzing a system of several parts as a whole, rather than just individual parts. The methodology is implemented in a usable software prototype which has a graphical interface for the data input and can be connected to conventional databases. The usability of the tool is shown with a handling system consisting of an industrial robot and a gripping system.}

abstract = {The chemical industry is constantly evolving by developing new technologies, green chemistry and designing chemical processes or products that are sustainable. However sustainable development is a complex and holistic approach that requires appropriate tools and consistent strategies to assist decision making at various stages. This work focuses on the development of a suite of systematic methods and integrated computer-aided tools for obtaining sustainable process flowsheets. These methods are based on a flexible three-stage process synthesis-design-innovation approach that can be used to solve different types of process engineering problems. This flexible approach can be used for solving new process synthesis problems, retrofit design problems or can be used as a process analysis tool to study any chemical process in detail. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the following aspects: How to solve complex process synthesis, design, and innovation problems by breaking them into small hierarchical subproblems and solving them efficiently and consistently so that one can obtain innovative and sustainable solutions. This work also highlights the degree of digitalization that can be achieved by using computer-aided tools like ProCAFD. The integration of ProCAFD with other computer-aided tools, including commercial simulation software to enhance the application range and scope of ProCAFD is also highlighted.}
